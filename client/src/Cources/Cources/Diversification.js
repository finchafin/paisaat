        Diversification & Investment Philosophy

      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Diversification means that you don’t invest all your money into one
        asset. You divide your investments into various different avenues so as
        risk mitigation can take place.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Diversification is a smart strategy used by investors to protect
        themselves from risk. For example if you are investing in stock market
        only and not on any other investment avenue, then no diversification has
        taken place. If tomorrow the stock market crash , you will lose all your
        money in it. If you had diversified a sum of amount to other investment
        avenue , like commodities or real estate, you could have protected your
        wealth better.

        Many people recommend on taking a diverse forms of mutual funds. Which
        is not a good strategy as mutual funds in itself is already a
        diversified fund in context to stock market. Buying more diversified
        mutual funds would just means that you are buying the same thing (stocks
        and bonds which are limited) through different sources. It’s like
        dividing a rock into pebbles and dividing pebbles into small marbles. So
        people recommend buy more rocks. But rocks are already diversified into
        same limited set of pebbles and marbles, why diversify more and make it
        more complex and useless. It’s a different scenario if the mutual fund
        is invested in money market instrument and other securities, then it can
        have some benefit , but again , you have to research about the fund
        before you see any tangible benefit. Because you should not tie your
        money in buying different mutual funds as that money can be used in
        other investment avenue to grow your wealth.

        Diversification happens in different level. First it happen in
        investment portfolio . 2nd It happens in stock market.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Stock market diversification means when you are investing in not only
        one company stock from one sector and industry but in different industry
        sector company stock , so as if one sector industry fell & shocks, the
        other can ride over the loss that an investor make in that loss making
        sector. For example if as an investor you invest all your money into one
        industry let’s say Automotive. Now lockdown happens and the sales of the
        automotive sector crashes. The price of the stock comes down and you
        lose all your money. Imagine if you would not have invested all of the
        amount in automotive and invested in pharmaceuticals stocks along with
        automotive, then the scenario would have been different. As during
        pandemic , the demand for medicines shot up, and hence the stocks of
        pharmaceutical company shot up as more production was happening in
        factories and more sales were happening. So even though you may have
        accrued losses in automotive industry, the pharmaceutical industry would
        provide you some relief from your losses. Diversification does not mean
        that you invest in different company. It means you invest in different
        sectors and industry so as to protect yourself from any downfall.
        Diversification does not mean investing in the stocks of TATA motors and
        Mahindra (both belong to same sector and same industry) , it means
        investing in TATA motors and Sun phrama pharmaceutical stocks. So such a
        diversification happens in Stock market is the right way of
        diversification.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Diversification in investment portfolio is important from an investor
        point of view. When you diversify in your investment portfolio it means
        that you don’t only invest in direct stock market, but you invest also
        in bond market, mutual funds market, commodity market, real estate, PF
        and FDs so as to distribute risk among various investment avenue and
        protect yourself from risk. You can divide your investment principal
        into various investment avenue and diversify. Then you can check how
        much an investment avenue is performing and you can decide accordingly.
        Also you can use diversification strategy to maintain liquidity in your
        investment portfolio. You can use various debt based securities or
        invest in REIT & INvIT to have liquidity. So that when you find yourself
        an investing opportunity but you lack liquidity, this diversification at
        that time would come handy to you.
      </p>

      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        So diversification in personal investment portfolio means investing in
        different investment avenues.
      </p>

      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Warren Buffet says :- Diversification is a protection against ignorance,
        It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Buffet was talking about the mutual funds diversification & wrong way of
        doing diversification . It’s always wise to diversify your investments
        but only when you diversify the right way. If you diversify the wrong
        way, it will not work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Many other investors say that diversifying poses the problem of not
        being able to keep watch on stocks (note I am using the word stock only
        ) if they diversify too much. There is just not enough time, energy and
        effort that one can use to keep track of those diversified stock
        investment done in a wrong way. Diversification in wrong way means that
        you buy multiple stocks of a similar industry and sector but of
        different companies. This is not diversification , although many claim
        it is. It is futile as it provides no risk mitigation or too little risk
        mitigation at the cost of risk diversification. Wrong way of
        diversification also means buying too many stocks which proves to be
        difficult to be tracked and maintained by you. So always buy a limited
        number of stocks. Investors say don’t be invested in more than 20 stocks
        at a time (that number is also for those who have gained a little
        experience in stock market) , because that would prove too tough to have
        an eye over.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        So to conclude this part , If you are diversifying , then diversify the
        right way. Diversification in stock market should be done the right way
        and invest in limited amount of stocks so you can keep track of the
        stocks that you are invested in and it does not overwhelm you. When
        diversifying in investment portfolio , diversification again does not
        mean to buy lots of different mutual funds as it serves no purpose and
        is wrong way of diversification. Invest in different investment avenues.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Many investors say , that it is better to master the skill of using
        their financial intelligence to master in any single investment avenue ,
        and then stay in those avenue to create big profit for themselves. You
        can also do that. Many known names have become master in developing
        their financial intelligence in a specific investment avenue and have
        gone on to become an expert in their field for example Warren Buffet in
        Stock market. If you want , then you can follow the same strategy and
        practices in one of the single investment avenue and become a master in
        it and create money for yourself. Then you won’t need diversification if
        you become top guy in your specialized investment avenue. That’s why
        Buffet today can claim that he does not need diversification cause he is
        an expert and great at the investment avenue he is playing in. But as a
        average investor , and someone who is new to the world of investing,
        until unless you don’t become expert in any one investment avenue, I
        suggest you to diversify your investment the right way. You can throw
        diversification out the window, once you have expertise in your mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        You must understand that every Investor has its own style of investing.
        Buffet has a style of investing which works best for him. Similarly
        there are other investors who has different style than buffet and that
        works for them. You got to find your own inner style of investing that
        works the best for you. Do not just blindly copy anyone. Be an original
        thinker. Find a way to make money work for you as best as it suits you.
        Do not follow anyone, and I repeat, anyone, without you using your
        Financial intelligence first. You may have your own unique style of
        investing that works for you that no successful investor follow, and
        that is absolutely okay. In the end, don’t get so caught up that you end
        up working for money. You don’t have to become the richest man on this
        earth. You just have to Create or earn only that much amount of money
        which is enough for you. Don’t try to become a big league player. Earn
        that much, that you need. Be content with what you have. Peace is much
        better then running your entire life in chaos for earning money. Do not
        be afraid to be you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Maybe your investment style would be to invest in mutual funds, or
        invest in saving scheme. Maybe those investment works the best for you.
        Or it can happen that you invest in real estate and investing in real
        estate works the best for you , or be it stock market value investing or
        trading. Whatever works for you the best, only you can decide that ,
        nobody else. So find your own investing style and what strategy of
        investment works the best for you and then stick to that and keep
        improving upon it with wise use of your financial intelligence. This is
        the very essence of financial empowerment.
