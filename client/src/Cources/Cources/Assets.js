        An asset is anything that puts money in your pocket even while you
        sleep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        An asset can be anything , like your bestselling book, your affiliate
        marketing page or blog, your business, your investments in investment
        avenues like real estate , stock markets, bonds ,Fixed deposit , public
        provident funds , your royalties from an art or from your patents, etc.
        Anything in which you don’t require your physical presence and
        involvement and it gives you money is asset for you.

        You being in debt is an asset for your bank. That’s why avoid the debt
        trap. The banks wants that you remain in debt, so that they can create
        money out of you. Be patient and don’t be an emotional fool, you may see
        your friends riding costly car with bank debt, or going to heavenly
        vacations by using bank debt or using up their savings, but by having a
        high emotional intelligence and IQ , learn to handle your emotions and
        not get swayed away by it. As I said before, emotional intelligence and
        IQ plays a good amount of role in your financial intelligence and IQ. In
        the world of social media , it easy to get swayed by your emotions when
        you see your contacts posting about their new homes or cars , or posting
        about their photos about them enjoying the forts of Rajasthan or the
        beauty of the Shimla . But don’t get swayed by all that. With emotional
        intelligence you can do achieve much more than they have or are
        achieving now. It’s not a competition. If you are happy for them that
        they are enjoying, and if you can celebrate along with them in their
        happiness then that is good. But if you can’t and seeing yourself
        struggle and them enjoying , and if that makes you jealous or when you
        start comparing your life with theirs, then I suggest you close your
        social media accounts and mind your own business. Your emotional
        intelligence plays a big role in your finance.

        When you are on the journey to create asset for yourself , do keep in
        mind that you generate enough of those so that you don’t have to work
        again. Set a goal for yourself , that I must have this much amount of
        asset , putting this much amount of money in my pocket every month
        without me working to earn money. Many people termed this as Financial
        Independence, where If you get fired from your job today, you still have
        enough asset so as your life continues unaffectedly. When you will have
        enough asset for yourself , you will not go to job to work for money ,
        but you will go because you enjoy it i.e. if you still keep working
        after you have attained financial independence. To work or not is your
        choice , but that’s not something that will be forced upon you because
        you have to survive. That’s the freedom Creators yearn for. The power to
        choose and not get forced on something .

        Investment avenues is a term made up of 2 words. Investment and avenues
        . Investment is when you invest your money to gain ROI, which is short
        for return on investment. Avenues means places. Investment avenues means
        simply , the places to invest to gain ROI.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        When you gain ROI from your assets and invest them again into assets , a
        chain of returns is formed which is termed as Compound interest , and
        with time it grows exponentially. Compound interest is the addition of
        interest to the principal sum, or in other words, interest on interest.
        It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so
        that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum
        plus previously accumulated interest.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Simple returns is just ROI. The interest you earn on your investment one
        time. But compound interest allows you to earn interest multiple times
        on your one investment or many. You can use compound interest to create
        a financial freedom base for yourself.

        investment avenues you can invest in and how by using your financial
        intelligence and IQ in them you can create a financial freedom base for
        yourself. We will see how people have used their financial intelligence
        and IQ to create a financial freedom base for themselves. We will talk
        about how we can use various avenues for our advantage and where people
        commit mistakes in them so we can learn from them.
