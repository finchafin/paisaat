        What is Forex market? Forex is short for Foreign exchange. Foreign
        exchange market is a market which is made up of currencies. People buy
        and sell currencies as their value keep fluctuating with respect to each
        other. Forex market comes in derivate market, you can only buy and sell
        in lots here. As US dollar is the world currency , people measure how
        much the 1 US Dollar is in value in that country currency. For example 1
        USD = 70 Rupees. Here is how the Forex market works.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Forex market is a open market , what that means is there is no statutory
        body to regulate it. Although in India, RBI does interfere, but only
        when RBI sees a disruption in this market that could affect the economy
        of India ( For example in 2011 when foreign investors withdraw huge
        amount of dollars from India making the economy volatile). Also RBI keep
        regulating the market if and when they see fit so it can be said that
        RBI does regulate the Forex market up to an extent to protect economic
        interest of this country.

        Dollar is connected to the oil. India imports lots of oil. And India
        buys these oils via US Dollars. From where does this US dollars come to
        India? Foreign Investors when they invest in India bring dollars with
        them, or From India Exports comes US Dollar. If in a short amount of
        time, Foreign investors pull their dollars back from the Indian market,
        the import-export equilibrium hampers and the economy gets thrown in
        turmoil. To protect itself against this sudden withdrawal of Dollars
        from the market, the RBI holds Foreign reserve in its vault to protect
        the economy of this country.

      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Again, the forex market works on the principle of demand & supply. Forex
        market is open market, what that means is that the market itself is
        allowed to decide the exchange value of Rupee w.r.t dollar. Forex market
        works in floating exchange rate, means there is no fixed exchange rate
        for currencies involved. What that means is that if today 1 USD= 60
        Rupees, then it is 100% possible that 1 USD = 65 Rupees tomorrow. And
        actually this happens a lot, you might have heard in news about
        reporters saying that rupee fall by this amount against dollar and or
        rise by this amount against dollar. What they are saying is the change
        in those exchange rates.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        For example let’s say 1 US Dollar = 60 Rupees. Now I am a shopkeeper who
        imports computer hardware like desktop from outside India and sell it in
        Indian market. So I have to buy in dollars and sell in rupees. Imagine
        due to certain market conditions, the dollar to rupee value slips to 65
        Rupees. What that means is that the rupee has depreciated in value. As
        an importer that is bad for me. Why? Because yesterday I have to pay 60
        rupees to buy a desktop ( assuming desktop was costing the shopkeeper 1
        USD) and sell it in 100. My profit was 40. But now I have to buy it in
        65 Rupees, and when I sell it in 100 rupees in Indian market, my profit
        is 35 Rupees. My profit margin decreases. So Rupee Depreciation is bad
        for importers. But what market conditions would lead to depreciating of
        Rupee?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        As I said before that in 2011, the FIIs (Foreign Institutional
        investors), or simply the foreign investors pulled out lots of amount of
        dollar from the Indian market. That increases the demand for dollar in
        Forex market of India. As the supply of Dollar was limited and its
        demand increased, the price of how much Rupee to pay to buy 1 dollar
        increases. And hence Rupee Depreciated. Now India who imports oil in
        large quantity has to pay more for its oil import.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        But as an exporter residing in India, Rupee depreciation is beneficial
        to me. Let’s see how.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Imagine I export Mangoes from India to another country. Till now , 1 USD
        = 60 Rupees. So I sell my produce at let’s say 1 USD in the foreign
        market. Rupee Depreciates. Now 1 USD = 65 Rupees. But I am benefiting if
        I keep my selling cost at 60 rupees only. My profit margin at 60 rupees
        selling point is let’s say 30. And I sell 5 mangoes in the foreign
        market for 60 Rupees at a profit of 30 each. What that means is that the
        foreign market pays me 5 USD and I earn 300 Rupees on my produce and a
        profit of 150 Rupees. Now as Rupee depreciate , and if I keep my selling
        price fixed that is 1 mango for 60 Rupees , then the foreign market
        would pay me 0.9 USD for my Mangoes , and I would still maintain my
        profit margin. But how does this benefit me as an exporter? Well it
        increases my competitive advantage as I am selling my produce at cheap
        prices over all the other competitors in the world. And it is costing me
        nothing. Also before, if the foreign market would give me an order of 5
        mangoes, they will increase the order for 10 mangoes as they too are
        being benefit by paying less dollar for the mango produce. So my profit
        as an exporter increases in terms of volume exchange of goods or
        services and via competitive advantage that cheap prices provides to me.
        So Rupee Depreciation is good for me as an exporter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        But again there is a catch here for exporters. Imagine I am making
        utensils that I am exporting to foreign countries. Now my manufacturing
        plant is set up in India, but I need raw materials to make utensils. Raw
        materials like minerals and metals. Now if some of those minerals or
        metals are not found in India, but is imported by India then this
        depreciation of Rupee is like walking in a double edged sword. At one
        look the import bill of company becomes costly, and at the other look
        ,the export profits of the company increases not in quality but in
        quantity of goods and services sold. So a company has to tread carefully
        and create a healthy equilibrium. Excess of Rupee depreciation can force
        the industries to close.

        Japan has done their currency depreciation (back in the 80s) against US
        dollar in order to make themselves competitive. Their automotive
        industry export various cars and other transports to America and to make
        them competitive against others in the world, they purposely deprecate
        their currency. Companies like Sony, Panasonic which are Japanese
        companies, just took massive market share in America by making their
        exports cheap and quality and at the same time profitable. Americans
        noticed this and in 1985 decided, along with other western economy to
        devalue dollar. This devaluation of dollar appreciated the Yen (Japanese
        currency). Now American local manufacturers or other manufactures of the
        world could compete with Japan. This led to a economic disturbance in
        Japan and since then there have been many boom and bust in the Japanese
        economy because of this. In only this decade, the exchange rate has
        become somewhat a little stable, and the Japanese companies have
        realised the folly of doing business with such wicked tactics.

      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        It is my personal opinion that such economic gimmick would never result
        in long term prosperity of any country. If any country has to grow the
        best thing that they can do is to create opportunity for Entrepreneurs
        to come out with solutions that people want or consumer wants. The best
        thing that a country can do is to incentivise people to take risk and if
        they fall then create an ecosystem where people can rise again to take
        risk and succeed. That is what would work in the long term for any
        country economic prosperity.

        Rupee Depreciation can increase inflation in the country. Because
        importers, to maintain their profit margin, can increase their selling
        price in India leading to inflation. RBI during post-pandemic period ,
        started to buy dollar and keep it in their vault as foreign exchange
        reserve. What that did was the demand for dollar in market increases and
        its supply became limited or scarce. That depreciated the rupee, as
        people have to pay more in rupees to buy 1 USD. This benefited
        exporters. That was the intended purpose of RBI for buying dollar from
        the open market, as it wanted to incentivise the Indian exporters. At
        the same time RBI was preparing itself if due to any reason , the FIIs
        or Foreign investors, like in 2011 they did, pull out dollars from the
        Indian market. If that happens then RBI would be better prepare to
        handle the situation this time and protect the Indian economy from the
        shock.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        What about Appreciation of Rupee? Well the whole thing plays out
        opposite. If dollar supply is more and demand is less in the open market
        then what happens is that it benefits importers and harm exporters.
        Imagine if 1 USD = 60 rupees today and it is 50 Rupees tomorrow. Then
        the exporters profit margin would cut to 20 rupees and the importer
        profit margin would increase by 10 rupees more.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        This was the economic part of Forex market. The investment and trading
        part is quite simple.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        As this exchange rate keep changing , people buy dollars or other
        foreign currency and hope that their respective currencies depreciate
        w.r.t to that. If I buy at 60 , 1 USD and Dollar becomes strong against
        that currency and it has become 1 USD= 65 , then I can sell my 1 USD and
        earn a profit. But remember you are in derivative market, and in
        derivative market you can only buy in lots not in single units. So
        profit or loss is always in multiples.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        So coming back to the question, what would happen if the dollar crash in
        the International market. Well that just simply means that demand for
        dollar would fall heavily. And if it does, then dollar would weaken and
        other currencies would appreciate in their value. Now why I said I Don’t
        know what would happen is because the Dollar today is linked to oil.
        Would the OPEC countries would stop selling their oil in Dollars? If it
        does that then India would be benefited from it. But at the same time a
        dollar crash would have an impact on our those services through which we
        earn dollars. For example our IT industry. They serve America and earn
        in direct dollars. The IT industry would see their revenue fall and
        there would be job losses. At the same time , I Don’t know if the
        countries would move towards a new currency which can be used as an
        international currency of exchange or whether they would move towards
        Cryptocurrency. The real answer is I don’t know or I don’t have the
        expertise to tell you, I am not knowledgeable enough perhaps. But if
        something like this happens then economic depression would surely
        happen. But whatever happens, make sure you are well prepared for it.
        Make sure that you develop your financial intelligence and IQ and you
        remain sound enough to be able to tide over tough times financially.
