        Insurance is a scheme in which you pay monthly or yearly instalments or
        premiums and in the event of something terrible happening to the thing
        which you have insured, the insurance will pay for it. You can get
        insurance for your car, home, your health, your life ,etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        In this particular scenario , we will not be talking about insurance on
        your car or home. We will be talking specifically about insurance on 2
        things, health insurance and life insurance.

        Health insurance is a wise option for an investor, as if you fall ill or
        tomorrow you need a major surgery done to stay alive, you need a lot of
        money for it, health insurance can provide for it. And Life insurance is
        the insurance that your family would get in the event of your
        unfortunate demise.

      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Enter into any private bank and they will start selling you schemes in
        the name of insurance. Never sign anything that the bank is selling you
        in the name of schemes or insurance. And never sign on something which
        you have not read.

        The following is author personal opinion and should not be regarded as
        standard procedure or advise. Please use your intelligence before coming
        to any conclusion.

        Health insurance is important because you cannot strain your assets for
        a sudden demand of money. As if you put too much strain on your asset
        they might break and your financial portfolio might break. So it is very
        helpful if you invest in health insurance. As it will provide a cover
        shock for you and your family against a sudden demand of money. Keeping
        a active and healthy lifestyle will also lower the risk of having this
        sudden demand of money. Stop buying advertised food products as they are
        the major reason for illness and falling health. But even after all
        this, it is good if you and your family are insured against illness or
        any major decision that can put strain on your asset and might break
        your assets. Many say , that we will earn money when we live, if we
        don’t live then how will we earn money. Money can be earned back , your
        health and life cannot.

      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        And that’s why once your life is gone, its futile to invest in a life or
        as I call it Death insurance. That’s because once you are dead , no
        sudden demand of money comes up because your already deployed assets are
        taking care of your family financial needs. Assets are making money for
        your family even after you die. Just make sure that you handle all the
        legalities in smart way so as your asset are deployed for people you
        want them to be deployed for. As many a times , a family gets in lawsuit
        and try to claim your asset as their, often your relatives will do such
        thing. So if you want to make your asset work for your parents , wife &
        children or a good friend of yours, then make a legal will and execute
        it. Not having a legal will , will throw your family in courtroom
        battle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Make enough asset that even when you are dead , they keep working for
        your family. When you would have reached such a level, even if you die ,
        you will die peacefully knowing that your family is taken care of by
        your assets and they don’t need to depend on anybody for financial
        matters. Not even you. That’s what the financial freedom is all about.
        It’s about independence, it’s about being reliable. It’s about being
        competent in your life in financial matters.

        What insurance company do is similar. They take your money or monthly
        instalment and invest in asset and various other investment avenue. As
        they know that not all of their customers are going to die in a single
        day , they take your money , invest in asset in various investment
        avenue and earn profit for themselves. They create profit out of a sense
        of security of you. Insurance industry thrives on fear. So instead of
        giving money to the agents of death insurance, you yourself do what they
        are doing. Cut the middleman. Why you need them to invest in asset for
        you? If you work on your own financial intelligence and empowerment you
        can build assets for yourself, why give money to someone else for it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Making your asset work for family after you die is good but remember the
        greatest asset is a person in itself. So while you are alive , teach
        financial empowerment to your nearest ones or to the ones who are
        relying upon you and dependent on you. For example your children.
        Financial empowerment is not taught in schools. They don’t tell in
        schools to invest in asset not in liabilities. So create strong
        financial empowered base for your children so they grow up to be
        financially wise. And in the process keep learning too as leanings never
        stop.
