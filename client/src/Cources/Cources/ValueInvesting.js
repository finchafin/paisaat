      Value investing is relax investing. There is no rush and push here. There is no impulse here and the investment decisions are backed by research. People like Warren buffet have built their wealth only by doing value investing.  
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Value investing is a type of investing in stock market , where an investor first research about a company statistics , ratios and company annual report and take a long term approach in their positions. There is no such thing as derivative market when you invest via using value investing ways. There is only cash market.
        </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        In value investing, investor researches generally about 4 things :- 
             </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '40px'}}>
        1. Company statistics & ratios
   
      <br />
   
        2. Management of the company 
      <br />
        3. Competitive advantage or float
        <br />
        4. Emotional intelligence
        </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Simply said, Value investors look for value in a stream of data.  Data and Finance are like samosa and chutney. When combine and tasted together, it is perfect and looks as it’s made for each other. 
        </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Even your most expert value investors do nothing but just search for value in data. The data generally consists of the above 4 things listed. Value investors analyse that data and come to a decision whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued and can it be a good investment opportunity. 
        </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Value investors hold their investment positions in them for long time. Warren buffet says that the stock that he invest in , he expect to hold them for infinite time. That is the amount of patience and emotional control that is required for a Value investor. At the same time , one must not be a fool and should check whether his initial decision to invest was correct or not when he realize that he is making loss via value investing way , cause not everyone is Warren Buffet.  If one thinks one has made a wrong decision in value investing , one should exit and book their losses and move on cause there can be better opportunity to invest but your holding to the particular stock for too long is passing up on that opportunity. That does not mean that you go on like a dog going from one stock to another as soon as you see an opportunity, you have to find your balance and make decision regarding whether a stock is worth holding anymore or is it just going to continue to make losses. You can check the company future growth prospect to help in making you a decision on whether to hold or sell in loss.  
        </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Let’s see how Value investors analyse the data and come to a decision on whether to invest in a company or not.

      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A company by law is mandated to publish its annual general report. This report contains the company information as to how much sales has been done, what loans if any company has taken, what is the revenue of the company, etc.  Among this data and statistics, the value investor look for specific terms of value.  These values are listed as below:-

        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Don’t get petrified by seeing such terms, it’s all very easy and non-complicated. Finance people love to use complex name for simple things.  What a value investor simply does is decide on the basis of these terms and more terms whether a stock is Undervalued or Overvalued.  We will talk what undervalue and overvalue means later. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        In this book we will take some of the terms and explain to you how you can search for value by assessing and analysing a company data. We will first explain the definition of the terms and then discuss how they showcase value of a company stock. Let’s start with the basics, called Earning per share.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Note :- No ratio & terms should be read independently, it should always and always and always be look with other ratio and terms in consideration and collaboration to reach a decision on how  a stock is valued.

        Earning per share (EPS)

        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Earnings per share or EPS is simply the metric which tell us how much a company earns per share. EPS indicates how much money a company makes for each share of its stock, and is a widely used metric to estimate corporate value.

        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        P/E ratio is short for Price of share/ earning per share. The price-earnings ratio is the ratio of a company's share price to the company's earnings per share.

        Debt to equity ratio

        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>        
        Debt to equity ratio simply represent the ratio of company debt obligation ( like if a company has taken loan and it has pay back it loan or other liabilities of company) with that of shareholder equity value.   This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It is widely considered one of the most important corporate valuation metrics because it highlights a company's dependence on borrowed funds and its ability to meet those financial obligations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Because debt is inherently risky, investors tend to favour businesses with lower D/E ratios. For shareholders, it means a decreased probability of bankruptcy in the event of an economic downturn. A company with a higher ratio than its industry average, therefore, may have difficulty securing additional funding from investors.

PEG focuses on EPS growth rate of the company , how it has been in the past and assess that in future it will grow at the same rate, or it will decrease or increase. PEG combines this EPS growth rate (future growth rate indirectly) to P/E (Past performance of company ) to give an investor an assessment of stock.

        Return on asset (ROA)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        The return on assets shows the percentage of how profitable a company’s assets are in generating revenue. This ratio or number tells you how many Rupees of earnings a company create from each Rupee of assets they control.  ROA gives a manager, investor, or analyst an idea as to how efficient a company’s management is at using its assets to generate earning.

        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Simply put , how much  profit or income the company assets are generating , that is determined by Return on asset. It is displayed as percentage.

        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Suppose there are two businesses. Business A and Business B. You have to decide on which business to invest in. With 100 Rupee investments, Business A is generating a profit of 40 Rupees. Business B is making a profit of 100 Rupees with 1,000 Rupees investment. Considering the other parameters remain same, as an investor in which business do you prefer to invest? The second business reported the higher profit, however, the first one is more efficient or has more “quality”. The former invested 100 and made a profit of 40 so if they invest 1,000 they will end up with a profit of Rs-400. In simple language, we can say, “Business A” has Return on Investment of 40% while the “Restaurant B” has 10%. So, “Business A” will naturally become the preferred choice for investors. Similarly, before investing in any stock, you need to consider the quality of the  business. Return on Equity helps to determine this quality of a business.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        The return on equity is a measure of the profitability of a business in relation to the equity. Because shareholder's equity can be calculated by taking all assets and subtracting all liabilities, ROE can also be thought of as a return on assets minus liabilities. ROE is displayed as percentage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        In simple words, Return on equity determines the “quality “of your investment. The more quality investment you have made, the better return you will get as a Value investor.

        Dividend Pay-out
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A company announces dividend which is the money that a company pay to its shareholder who holds its shares. The company give dividend out of the profit that a company makes. The percentage of dividend that a company gives , with respect to the company profit, that is analysed by Dividend pay-out ratio. A company doesn’t give all the profit (also called earnings or income) of the company to its shareholders in the form of dividend. It will give a percentage of profit to shareholder in the form of dividend, the rest company will retain with itself and may use for expanding their business. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        The dividend pay-out ratio provides an indication of how much money a company is returning to shareholders versus how much it is keeping on hand to reinvest in growth, pay off debt, or add to cash reserves (retained earnings).

        The vast majority of dividends are paid four times a year on a quarterly basis, but some companies pay their dividends semi-annually (twice a year), annually (once a year), monthly, or more rarely, on no set schedule whatsoever (called “irregular” dividends).

        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        The book value of equity, in turn, is the value of a company's assets expressed on the balance sheet. Book value per share indicates the amount that each shareholder should receive if the company liquidates completely. Liquidate means to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents by selling them on the open market. Liquidate is also a term used in bankruptcy procedures in which an entity chooses or is forced by a legal judgment or contract to turn assets into a "liquid" form (cash). The book value is defined as the difference between the book value of assets and the book value of liabilities.

        Value investors find value from these data . After valuing companies, they decide whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued.  Such a method of research is called fundamental analysis. An undervalued stock means that its share price is lower than its value. For example , a stock  true intrinsic value is 100 Rupees ( this stock value is derived from Valuation technique ) but it is hovering at a price of 80 . Then market correction would happen and in due time , this undervalued stock would go above 100. Let’s assume that the stock reaches 200 rupees in due time. Now this stock is overvalued. The stock price won’t grow much from here as it’s already overvalued. The only place it will go is down, as market correction would happen. It reaches 100 from 200 in due time, the investors who invested in overvalued stock lose their money.  This example is taken just so you can understand what undervalued stock and overvalued stock means.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Value investors uses these terms & value findings from data to recognise stocks that are currently undervalued and are showing growth promises in future. How do they do that?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        If you look at P/E ratio, then investors calculate the last 3 to 5 years (some does for last 10 years also) P/E ratio and calculate its average. Then they look at the current P/E ratio of the stock and compare it with the last 3 to 5 years average P/E ratio. Let’s assume that last 5 years P/E ratio average is 10 & current P/E ratio is 7. This means that the stock currently is undervalued in terms of P/E and may offer future growth opportunities of the company (determined by other value metrics) and increase demand of the stock in future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        P/E often represents the demand of a particular stock.  P/E in its truest sense represents that how many investors are attracted to that one particular stock. The more the attraction, the greater the demand and higher would that stock price go in due time.  P/E represents how much money an investor is willing to pay to earn 1 rupee from that stock. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        There are often stocks that go unrecognised by investors.  These stocks are not in demand by the investors. Hence these stocks P/E go down. As I said before, a value investor finds value in the stream of data. These value investors hunt for such stocks and buy these stocks after checking all other valuation metrics along with P/E.  With due time, Investors starts to recognise these stocks and its price goes up. Mainly because a company may publish the profit it made on a quarter. Or they are announcing expansion plan and it got published in the news, or any incident which makes investors recognise these stocks and its demand to go up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        It can also happen a stock has low P/E because that company is really suffering and nobody wants that stock. A company may be going downhill in their sales and might be struggling in marketplace and there is no sign of growth in those company, or investors thinks that company may soon go bankrupt,  so investor have dumped that company shares. As I said you got to look for other value metrics to determine the health of the company.  Studying P/E alone would not help you in deciding whether the company is undervalued or overvalued. You got to study P/E with other ratios in collaboration.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A low current P/E ratio when compare with the Average P/E of the last 3 or 5 years, can be a sign of an undervalue stock.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A Debt to equity ratio is good for an investor if it is below or equal to 2. A debt to equity ratio tells an investor on whether the company is showing its profit on the basis of taking loans from banks and compensating for their loss. This loan has to be paid back by company , and if the company is not earning much money without the help of debt, then that company future growth prospect is seriously in trouble and management of that company is questionable.  A higher debt to equity ratio shows that the company is running or sustaining itself on debt , not on sales , revenue or profit. Taking on debt is good until unless the management knows what it is doing. So if the debt of a company is high, start looking for some inefficiency in that company. Also don’t asses any financial institution or banks with this ratio, as their business model is different from the generally known business model.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A PEG of 1 or less than one is good for an investor. One weakness of the P/E ratio is that its calculation does not take into account the future expected growth of a company. The PEG ratio builds upon the P/E ratio by factoring growth into the equation. Factoring in future growth adds an important element to stock valuation. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A Return of equity (ROE) greater than 20% is good for an investor. An ROE less than 20 % raises question about company efficiency or quality of that business. ROE determines how much quality a business or company has. ROE greater than 20 % means that those company are efficient and quality one. While less than 20 % means that company is less efficient or has average quality.  Look for the increasing ROE and Decreasing ROE trends in the company, if it is increasing then good, if it is decreasing then become caution.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A Dividend pay-out is good to have for liquidity of cash in hands of the investors. A stock having dividend pay-out drives that stock prices up and makes it more in demand. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        If any company goes bankrupt today, would you lose all the money along with that company or will you get your due? P/B tells an investor , what would a investor may get or not , or what a company is left with, if tomorrow company goes bankrupt or declare itself insolvent or shut itself down.  P/B value under 3 is good for an investor. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        As I said before, no ratio should be looked at in silos.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        If ROE is high and P/B is low, that would signify that stock has potential for returns on investment.  If you have low ROE and high P/B then it signifies that stock is overvalued. There is case for concern and an investor must look deeply into company to find what wrong. ROE and P/B correlate to each other well and goes hand in hand.

        1) Management of the Company
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        When investing in a company, it is important to know who is managing that company and who is the leading it. A good business can go to ruin if management of a company is incompetent. It is always helpful to check if the management of the company is good or bad..
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        How do you check whether a company management and its board of directors is good or bad?  You can see who has invested in the company previously and is now in board of directors.  You can do research and find out that, are the board of directors are invested in another company, and if yes then how it is performing and have performed in the past in market.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        You can verify if the management of the company is good or not by seeing if the promoters are selling their stock or buying their own company stocks, a term called share buyback. Promoters can buy share for various of reasons, like if they see the their company stock prices falling, and they want to stop it , they would buy more. This will sent a positive sentiment in the market for that stock. It shows that the management is willing to bet on their company performance. It shows that the management is confident. They can buy back for another reason also, for example, if the company shares are undervalued and promoters see an undervalue stock of their company shares, they will buy it. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        If the promoters are selling their shares, then become caution. Promoters can sell their stake because they know something is wrong inside the company function and soon the price of the stock is going to crash. If you see promoters selling their stakes in company , without any rationale behind it , then be aware of a fraud in making.  As soon as a company promoters sell their stake , the price of the stock would drop in market. Companies promoters selling their stakes is a negative thing , and you must dig deeper into company to know why promoters are selling their stakes and whether the company is going through a turmoil or facing problems. For example, the case of Satyam (Company name). Its founder fraudulently inflated the company profit using accounting gimmick. This was a scam. The promoter and the founder knew this, and during this time they sold their holdings in company.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        A caution of note here but, many promoters might be selling their stakes to raise funds from investors, if that is the case then you can relax a bit, cause business raising funds for their business is common thing. But you still got to keep an eye on that business management .
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Another is when promoters use their stocks to get loans.  This is called Pledging of shares. Promoters give their stocks as collateral for bank to get loans.  Small percentage of pledging by promoters is okay, but if it grows large then that’s a problem.  Investors think that pledging is the last option for a promoter to raise funds from market or bank.  There has been many examples where promoters who sold their stakes in their own company and pledge their shares , which crashed their stock market prices in stock market , so if you see any of this thing , stay aware .

        There are institution which focuses only on investment. These institutions have a team of researchers and financial analyst scrutinising any company and finding good investment opportunity. The institution investors which preside inside the country are called domestic institution investors (DII). The institution investors who reside outside the country are called Foreign institution investors (FII). If FII and DII has invested and hold a stake in a company, then it automatically speaks for the reputation of the management of the company.

        Investors look for a competitive advantage which can keep the business thriving for long time. For example, Apple. Apple has a 2 competitive edge over their competitors, these are brand and information lock. People who use Apple , cannot transfer their data and contacts to any other brand phone or operating system. This restrict the choice of their customer , as taking on new operating system would mean that they will lost their data with that change. Also By being associated with a brand, they become loyal to that company and rarely want to choose another company.  They think that they are buying the best thing for themselves , that’s what branding does. Branding creates a perception in the minds of the consumer that the given company is best in a specific field.

        So if you can find competitive advantage, then it’s good for the company you invest in. It’s okay if you don’t find one, if the company statics are strong and the management is good, and you anticipate growth in that company, you can invest in it.

        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        In value investing , you have to be patient and in control of your emotion.  Many say that investing is 90% emotional and 10 % technical.  Once you have invested in a particular stock Don’t repeatedly keep on checking its price. With the invent of Television and websites and internet, the information of stock prices is thrown at you at a faster rate than you can breathe.  Let me tell you straight away, all that is nonsense. Don’t get caught up in the frenzy and madness. Don’t check prices of stock 5 times a day. You can check stock prices in which you are invested in 1 time in every 15 days or so or 1 time every week and how it has performed in such time. Keep yourself away from sources which throw information at you second by second. Having thrown stock prices where your money is invested and repeatedly checking prices will lead you to become impulsive. Avoid impulsive action. Stock market is not about excitement. If you want excitement then go to a mela, or to a daring sports adventure. Don’t come to stock market to gamble your money with excitement. Everybody is doing it so should I, kill this thought in your mind.

        Every time you visit your stock prices , if you want , you can redo the valuation. It’s not necessary , but if you want to be double sure or anything then you can re-evaluate the stock. After 1 year, it’s compulsory to revaluate the stock as many metrics can change and starts to grow red. Keep an eye that any valuation metric don’t start to go red.  
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        Rather than repeatedly checking prices of your stock 5 times a day , keep a close eye on the company in which you are invested in. See if that company is in news and for what reason. Any major news can have effect on the stock that you are invested in. Keep a close eye on the company you are invested in.

        In value investing you have to wait for 1 year or more than 1 year to start realizing gains generally. It can happen that you may start realizing profit in less than one year. The question arises when you can sell. If you sell early and after selling you see that the prices of the stock is still rising and you lost an opportunity to earn more, well learn to just not make regret of it. You cannot predict the market price of a stock whether it will go up or go down. But a suggestion here, People often hold the stock which are making losses for longer time , and sell the stocks which are making profit very early. Do the opposite, Hold Profitable stocks for long and sell loss making stock early. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
        If you think that in valuation you have made a mistake or you have missed something, re-evaluate your loss making stocks. Wait for some time and if you see your loss making stocks go further down then instantaneously check what’s wrong with the stock. Is it just a temporary blip or change in the market or the valuation has problem? Take a decision then on whether to dump the stocks and book your losses or wait for the temporary blip or change to correct itself in market. The point here is just give enough time to stocks to mature. You have to create a fine balance of giving enough time to stocks to mature and taking a decision on selling or holding the stocks.  That’s where your financial intelligence and emotional intelligence will work a lot. You have to take a decision based on valuation of the company on what to do, when to buy and when to sell.  Keep in mind to be patient.
