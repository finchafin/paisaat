      Gold and silver are the two most popular commodities. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      When the stock market crash, the prices of gold & silver goes up because investors flock to these safe haven. As a result the prices of gold and silver shoots up every time stock market crash. Wise investors keep gold in their portfolio. When the stock market crash and gold prices go up, they sell gold at higher prices.  Stock market crash is an excellent opportunity to buy good stocks at cheap prices. The money that they get from selling gold, investors either retains the profit from that or invests their profit in stock market. Later when stock market recovers, the stock prices also go up and investors then sell these stocks in profit. The profit they get from selling these stocks, they either retain the profit or invest a portion of it back to gold or silver. So in future if any crash happens again , they again create profit from that crash.

      Many other investors use commodities to hedge against inflation and protect themselves from the currency devaluation. For example , If the fed reserve of America keeps printing money out of thin air and inject too much fiat currency in the marketplace ,the value of dollar would fall. That means that the purchasing power of dollar would fall. Inflation would rise, leading to the increase in prices of hard asset like real estate & commodities.  Such investors use commodities as a protection.  These investors predict on the basis that the fed has injected a lot of fiat currency in marketplace and the dollar is going to crash and a condition of hyperinflation would set in the marketplace. Having commodities and hard asset at that time would work wonders for investors who have gold or silver and other commodities.

      While other investors like Warren buffet says that investing in gold is not a good option as gold just sits there and does not make you any money.  Warren Buffet quotes :- 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      “Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. It’s a lot better to have a goose that keeps laying eggs than a goose that just sits there and eats insurance and storage and a few things like that.”

      Silver and other metals and minerals are categorised as industrial mineral, because these metals and minerals are used in factory to create product. So demand and consumption of products that are derived from these metals affect the prices of these commodities. So one has to keep an eye on how the market is doing and which product is in demand in the marketplace and is being consumed by consumers. While silver price will fluctuate in line with gold as an commodity to hedge against stock market crash and inflation, the industrial supply & demand equation for silver exerts an equally strong influence on its price. So you have to keep a check on both.

      Many investors also invest in mining companies which are ecologically very bad but they provide good hedge against inflation. Oil well and shores, and other mineral mining companies , investors used them as not only they provide commodities and ownership in minerals that the mining company owns but also acts as a business company , hence eliminate the thought of Warren buffet sitting idle comparison.
