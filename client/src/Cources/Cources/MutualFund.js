      Mutual funds are very popular those people, who don’t understand anything about stock market. Mutual funds allow people to become a player of stock market without them doing anything other than just contributing money . Which stock to buy , to hold and to sell , a manager whom are called fund manager decides. A fund manager takes all the decision of investing with the pool of money collected from those who invest in mutual funds.  Fund manager is also called portfolio manager. Portfolio is a term to denote a bag of investments. I mean , its literally just a collection of investment an investor makes. So portfolio manager means in simple English , manager of a collection of investment. Mutual funds mainly invest in stocks and bonds, but they also invest in money market instruments and other complex financial derivatives, assets & securities.

      Mutual funds issue share to its investors when they buy a mutual fund. Investing in a share of a mutual fund is different from investing in shares of stock. Unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give its owners any voting rights. A share of a mutual fund represents investments in many different stocks (or other securities) instead of investment in a single stock. You can sell and buy these shares in the open market.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      The value of the mutual fund company depends on the performance of the securities it holds. So, when you buy a unit or share of a mutual fund, you are buying the performance of its portfolio or a part of the portfolio's value. That's why the price of a mutual fund share is referred to as the Net Asset Value (NAV) per share.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      A fund's NAV is calculated by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the total amount of shares outstanding. Outstanding shares are those held by all shareholders, institutional investors and others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Mutual fund shares can typically be bought at the fund's current NAV, which—unlike a stock price—doesn't fluctuate during market hours, but it is settled at the end of each trading day.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Net Asset Value =[Assets – (Liabilities + Expenses)]Number of outstanding units
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      A lot of investors think of net asset value as being similar to a stock price in stock market trading and value investing. This causes them to believe that a fund with a lower net asset value is cheaper and hence, a better investment. In truth, it is not an indicator of mutual fund performance. A lower value alone does not make a fund a better investment or vice versa. Hence, it should not be the only determining factor to choose a mutual fund.  Nor should you buy stocks in trading and value investing market just because its cheap, buy only after careful valuations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      That is why it is not wise to base your investment decision on NAV of a scheme. Comparing the NAV of two mutual fund schemes does not tell you anything about their future prospects. NAV reflects the total value of the schemes investments minus liabilities and expenses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      So, a higher NAV simply means that the scheme’s investments have fared really well. Or the scheme has been around for a long period. The NAV only impact the number of units you can buy. For example If a mutual fund has a NAV of ₹200, then that is how much you will have to pay for one unit of that mutual fund. Conversely, if you invest ₹5,000 in a mutual fund with a net asset value of ₹200, then you will get 25 units of that fund.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      From an investor perspective, mutual funds provide a good opportunity to diversify your investments. By word Diversification, I mean that if you invest let’s say 500 Rupees in a mutual fund you will be invested not only in one stock but multiple of stock and other securities. This provides an advantage as if one of the stocks performed poorly , you will have protection from it as your investment in it via mutual funds is only partial in it. For example you invest 500 Rupees via mutual fund. Your amount would be distributed among multiple stocks and bonds so even if one stocks fails, your loss is only partial in it. Your other investments can still make you profit.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Mutual funds are of 2 types. First is called active mutual funds and 2nd is called passive mutual funds.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Active mutual funds are those funds , where an active manager look for securities to buy and earn profit from. When you choose to invest in a active mutual funds, the cost that you have to pay increases. You have to pay for the entry fees when you buy active mutual funds and also you have to pay the mutual fund manager for his services via a larger cut in the profit you make. In this funds, the manager of the mutual fund do active research in market and search for investment opportunity, which cost you. For example imagine you made a profit of 100 Rupees in active mutual fund. 40 rupees of that would be taken by the mutual fund manager as his fees and there will be hidden cost associated with it in different finance nonsense terminologies. Like exit load fees , which in simple English means, when you exit from a fund, you have to pay a fee every time you do that. Such hidden cost burden which are not clearly stated at the time of investment, leads to realization of less profit by  the investors. So if you are investing in active mutual funds , read all the hidden cost clearly to calculate your profit. Do a background check on the mutual fund manager as well. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Passive mutual funds are those funds, in which you directly invest in the NIFTY or Sensex without any active involvement of Mutual fund manager. The mutual fund manager in this case just allocate the money or invest timely in NIFTY and Sensex ,without doing any active research in market. As the manager is not doing an active research for investment opportunities here, the cost you own is decrease substantially . Imagine you earn a profit of 100 Rupees in passive mutual funds, out of that 100 rupees, the manager takes 15 rupees for his fees and hidden cost. Hence increasing your profit retention.  
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      What do you think, which one is better? Active mutual fund or passive mutual funds?
      </p>
      <br />

      In 2008, Warren buffet challenged the Active mutual funds managers to create more profit for their investors then a passive mutual funds create and give to its investors. Some active mutual funds manager took on the challenge of buffet. Buffet said if active mutual funds returns to investors were higher , he would give a million dollars to the active mutual funds manager.  The time limit was set for 10 years. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Warren buffet won that challenge. The active mutual funds manager were not able to generate as much return for their investors as a passive mutual funds did. That was because the fees and cost and expense related to Active mutual funds cut into the profit of investors. In passive mutual funds, these fees and cost were very low, as manager did not have to do much. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      If you are investing in mutual funds, invest in passive mutual funds, try to avoid active mutual funds. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Furthermore  , mutual funds are divided into various categories. Equity based (where manager invest only in equities , which are further more divided into mid cap, small cap, large cap and multicap funds , index funds(NIFTY and Sensex) , etc) , Debt based ( only invest in bonds and other fixed income securities, etc) ,etc. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      You can invest in Mutual funds via Systemic investment plan (SIP), Systematic Withdrawal Plans(SWP) and Systematic Transfer Plan(STP). 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      In SIP, you invest a particular sum every month , irrespective of how the market is performing. In SWP plan, the investors redeem a particular amount from his investment every month. This useful if somebody has no other income source other than mutual funds. In SWP plan , you can withdraw money every month from your investment in mutual funds. In STP, an investment management fund has the power to switch between mutual funds. For example if you are invested in equity mutual funds and you want to switch to debt based mutual funds , then you can transfer certain units of your equity mutual funds to debt based mutual funds. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Just as in a mutual funds an active manager looks for the investment opportunities, there is this another category called Fixed maturity plans (FMP). FMP are close end mutual funds. Close end mutual funds are a collective investment scheme with a limited number of shares. New shares are rarely issued once the fund has been launched, and shares are not normally redeemable for cash or securities until the fund liquidates.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>

      FMP invest in various financial strument which have a maturity date, rather than investing in stocks and all. FMP provide less risk to an investor. FMP invest in government securities, corporate debt, commercial papers and money market instruments which gives a steady returns to investors. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      There are so many mutual funds out there, which one is best for you? Well that depends on what your aim is. I mean if you want to have a monthly income , then go STP plan of mutual funds. If you are looking for some long term capital gains, go for equity mutual funds. If you are looking for debt based funds , then invest in debt based mutual funds. If you are looking for term & maturity based securities investment then invest in FMP.  Invest in passive index funds as it will give you higher return than active mutual funds. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      Before selecting mutual funds, do check who is the manager of the mutual funds. If a mutual fund has performed better in the past , that does not mean it would perform better in the future too. Keep this in mind , and check all the other parameters , like what’s happening in the market and how its doing.  What is the turnover ratio of the mutual funds. Which plan is best for you. Do you want to invest in equities, or do you want to invest in debt and securities ? This all determines which mutual funds and what plans of mutual funds you should choose. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>
      When selecting a mutual fund , pay attention to hidden costs, fees, exit or entry load fees and other expenses.  Your expenses can cut down a large portion of your profit , so keep a sharp eye on it. 
      </p>

      Rupee cost averaging is a phenomena which means that when the stock market is going through bear phase ( that is , the stock market is performing poorly and negative sentiments prevail in stock market as happen for example during stock market crashes) then an investor gets a great opportunity to buy mutual fund units at lower price because NAV is lower as asset are not performing well in market. At this point the investor goes on a buying spree and starts buying mutual  fund units. As the market recovers, so does the worth of investor investment. And you can gain profit if you take on a long term approach using Rupee cost averaging.
