They (People) were cheated out of the system. In 2008 economic crisis, people paid and are to this day still paying and might tomorrow be still paying , the cost of some big banks greed. What happened in 2008 economic crisis was that banks had created financial product which stopped working. Banks had bought insurance against those financial product , so when they fail, they would get the insurance money. It turns out that the insurance company never expected the financial product to fail and has given the insurance company owner huge bonuses (amounting to millions in Dollars) as if there is no tomorrow. You must understand that banks bought those product using yours and mine Savings or deposit money. Because they are allowed to do that by the US Law. While this was playing out , the banks to save their skin and make more profit out of those failed financial product that went bad, started to create more of that financial product.  Now you might get confused and asked, if a financial product has gone bad, why create more? Well so that the banks can buy insurance against it. So when more amount of financial product fails, the banks which has bought insurance goes rich. So banks purposely created this bad financial product ( Collateral debt obligations \u2013 the name of the financial product ) and start selling to the general public and investors. The banks knew that these products are faulty and bad and it will bring losses to the investors , still they sold it , and sold it in millions of Dollars. Perhaps even in billions of dollars.  You don\u2019t need to own the financial product to be insured against it downfall. For example if I own a house , then I pay for its insurance, but in this scenario of financial product, I can buy its insurance even if I don\u2019t own it.  So what happens is that when a financial product fails , the insurance company has to pay to multiple people and not only to those who hold such financial product. And when these financial product went bad, general public or investors paid for it, like the Virgin island pension fund and many other, who sued one of the bank who sold them the faulty financial product. And as previously said , the insurance companies never expected these financial products to go bad, why? Because this particular financial product was made up of real estate. But it did go bust, and when it goes bust & insurance company did not have the money to pay to banks, the whole system collapsed. And we had what is called the 2007-08 economic crisis.  How was the problem solved? The banks went to Federal reserve and then to the President of the USA and warned him that if he does not take steps then the whole financial system would collapse, people savings and deposit would be lost. So the president of USA agreed to give money to these banks to cover their losses. But where did this money came from? The US government issued new bonds that were to be fulfilled with time via the taxpayers, and then gave it to the federal reserve in exchange for money. Now where did the federal reserve got the money to buy bonds from the government? They printed or created it out of thin air. From nothing. And the wicked part of all this is , the bond that government sold to fed reserve they had to be paid back via the taxes the government took from you and me. What that means is that the big banks blows up the world, and it is the common public that pays for it , not the banks.

Now these specific set of numbers are connected to the hash of the previous block and it\u2019s the current block numbers which act as a linking agent for the next block to add itself.  So in the case of hacking if someone changes the hash number of any particular block, then it automatically changes all the subsequent block associated with it , and that is why hacking such a system is very difficult.

When you do a transaction via using this technology, what it does it puts that transaction in a pool of unverified data. What that means is that if you need your transaction to complete, it should be on the blockchain for everyone to see and verify.

First is that this system of computer guessing (and there is no other way to solve this problem, remember the hash that we talked about and correlate that with here) takes a lot of time.  A block of chain is added every 10 minutes and it can be added only at every 10 minutes interval, not before 10 minutes and not after 10 minutes. And if you are lucky enough to add your block to the blockchain, and imagine that you have to verify the 2nd transaction, then you would not be able to do that in the next 10 minutes? Why? Because other people are also trying to get their block adds to the blockchain to verify their transaction. There is a competition going on. Now you might say that those people who have a supercomputer or high power hunky dunky computer will then makes the most number of transactions and would not let other people use the technology. Well no, the technology is designed in such a way that when your computer guess the number for the first time, then the 2nd time the difficulty level for your specific computer is increased so others get fair chance to add their block.
