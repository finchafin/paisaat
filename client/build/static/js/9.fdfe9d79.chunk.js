As I said before, emotional intelligence and IQ plays a good amount of role in your financial intelligence and IQ. In the world of social media , it easy to get swayed by your emotions when you see your contacts posting about their new homes or cars , or posting about their photos about them enjoying the forts of Rajasthan or the beauty of the Shimla . But don\u2019t get swayed by all that. With emotional intelligence you can do achieve much more than they have or are achieving now. It\u2019s not a competition. If you are happy for them that they are enjoying, and if you can celebrate along with them in their happiness then that is good. But if you can\u2019t and seeing yourself struggle and them enjoying , and if that makes you jealous or when you start comparing your life with theirs, then I suggest you close your social media accounts and mind your own business.

Many people termed this as Financial Independence, where If you get fired from your job today, you still have enough asset so as your life continues unaffectedly. When you will have enough asset for yourself , you will not go to job to work for money , but you will go because you enjoy it i.e. if you still keep working after you have attained financial independence.
