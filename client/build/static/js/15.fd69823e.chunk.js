It has a lot to with how the schooling education system came into being. You are not taught the values of courage in school, no character development takes place and no financial education is there in school although we deal with finance in our day to day life. The schooling education system of idea was inspired by the Prussian system whose idea was to create a system of establish labor to work for factory and corporations. Such a system does not allow any questioning , and discouraged breaking of rules. Just do what you are told, or else you will face bad consequences was the system motto. Such a system was created by some very rich and powerful elite people to keep people make themselves surviving constantly, not thrive among themselves. They wanted an army of workers , where each worker work fight for its own survival and not on the survival or thriving of each other and of their own. Forget thriving , people find it difficult to survive , so they have developed an system of \u201clook for myself only\u201d.

Not only this, But financial IQ is also about how aware you are about legalities . For example in real estate you have to not only negotiate toughly but also have to use your financial IQ to the fullest to actually land a deal that is workable and also protect yourself from financial predators at the same time. More of it is discussed later in this book. An example of financial IQ in action is as follow:- imagine you are buying plants and you went to a plant shop for that. Now you went there and bought a Tulsi plant for let\u2019s say 300 Rupees. This is scenario number 1. Now scenario number 2. You go to the plant shop to buy a Neem plant. But this time instead of giving whole 300 rupees , you get to know that government is subsidizing the tax rate in it in a push to incentivize healthy and greener surroundings. So you use that subsidizing tax claim and pay 250 Rupees. The simple act of knowing about tax deduction and using it effectively is an example of Financial IQ in action.
