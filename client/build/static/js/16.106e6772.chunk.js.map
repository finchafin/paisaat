People used to exchange\r\n        goods with goods. For example, if I want 1kg rice and I have shoes to\r\n        exchange it with, I will give shoes to the person who is giving me rice.\r\n        Here exchange of goods took place. Such a system is termed as barter\r\n        system.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Problems arose when in barter system , goods were not accepted that were\r\n        not desirable. For example I want rice, but the person giving rice does\r\n        not want shoes, he wants clothes. In such a scenario , I cannot exchange\r\n        my shoes for rice. To solve this problem , minerals & metal were\r\n        introduced .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Minerals are rare and so they hold a value. Many minerals were also used\r\n        in human activities, like in weapons or jewelry. People introduced coins\r\n        of minerals for exchange, like gold coins , silver coins and copper\r\n        coins. The rarer the mineral , the higher value It has. So gold has high\r\n        value , silver has lower value than gold and copper has lower value than\r\n        silver. Now If I wanted to buy 1 kg rice, I would just give either 2\r\n        gold coins to seller, or 10 silver coins to seller or 20 copper coins to\r\n        seller that I have earned by selling my shoes in the marketplace.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Problems arose when traders and merchants use to carry large amount of\r\n        gold and valuable from one town to another. There was constant fear of\r\n        their valuable getting stolen. Also carrying large amount of copper\r\n        coins or other mineral coins was both dangerous ( in terms that they\r\n        might get stolen) and inconvenient . To solve this problem, people\r\n        invented institutions to store their valuable and termed it as bank.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Bank provides receipt of certificate when people deposit their gold in\r\n        the bank. For example for 10 gram of gold deposited in banks, banks gave\r\n        me 100 receipt of certificate. Now imagine I used a taxi service from\r\n        going to one place to another. Instead of exchanging minerals directly ,\r\n        I give 10 notes of receipt of certificate to taxi driver. This taxi\r\n        driver can go to bank and claim the percentage of gold that 10 notes of\r\n        receipt of certificate would provide him or he can just use those 10\r\n        notes to exchange it in the marketplace for buying other goods and\r\n        services. These receipts of certificate are called currency or money.\r\n        Currency solved the problem of inconvenience that minerals presented and\r\n        also kept the value of the valuables intact and in safe locations in\r\n        bank.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        As this convenient approach of currency or money exchange came into\r\n        marketplace , people directly started building a market which was based\r\n        on exchange of money. Rather than always going now and then to the bank\r\n        , unless special condition arises , people stop going to bank to\r\n        exchange their money for gold & started doing transaction in terms of\r\n        money only.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Bankers saw an opportunity in this. What bankers did is they evolved\r\n        themselves from storing valuable to lending valuables of depositors to\r\n        borrowers and charging them high interest rates. They started to issue\r\n        more money for the limited amount of gold that they had. As people were\r\n        not coming to claim gold and they were using currency or money directly\r\n        for exchange, bankers started issuing more amount of money in\r\n        marketplace for the limited amount of gold that they had. Banks would\r\n        get in trouble if all the people at the same time claim gold for the\r\n        money that they hold with themselves, because simple, bank does not have\r\n        that much amount of gold. But people don’t come at once to claim their\r\n        money and exchange it for gold. If you have 100 notes for 10 gram of\r\n        gold and if I have 100 notes from the bank ,and if we both together go\r\n        and at the same time claim gold for our 100 notes each, the bank would\r\n        be in a problem. The bank only has 10 gram of gold, not 20 gram of gold.\r\n        But you and I rarely go the bank to claim our gold. And the whole\r\n        banking system function on this one supposition or probability that all\r\n        the people would not come at the same time to claim their gold.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Banks then became eligible to issue loans in this way to people & charge\r\n        borrowers for taking loan. You read that right, banks issue loan for\r\n        things that they don’t have in their vault. This charging people extra\r\n        money , for taking loan from banks is called interest rates. If you\r\n        deposit money , or give money to bank but only for safekeeping not for\r\n        exchanging it for gold, banks give you an interest rate for that. Banks\r\n        would then lend your deposit to borrower at high interest rate than what\r\n        they offer you for your deposit. The difference in these 2 interest rate\r\n        produces profit for the bank. For example, I deposited 100 rupees at the\r\n        bank, the bank gave me 3 % interest rate on it. The bank lends out my\r\n        100 Rupees to borrower at 8 % interest rate. This 5 % interest rate is\r\n        the profit of bank.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        In 1971 , USA President Nixon, took the world out of the gold standard.\r\n        Before 1971 , your money guaranteed you that when you go for exchanging\r\n        your money for gold , you will get an fixed gold for that . For example\r\n        if I had $100 I can exchange it for 10 gram of gold. Here $100 = 10 gram\r\n        gold. After the world went out of gold standard , now $100 is not equal\r\n        to 10 gram of gold. Then what is $100 equal to? What valuable thing did\r\n        Nixon find which was more valuable than minerals? A promise. If you look\r\n        at your note right now, it says there “ I promise to pay the bearer this\r\n        and this amount” . The money which had value derived from gold, that\r\n        money became a derivative of promise (more technically correct word to\r\n        use here would be debt, but lets keep things simple as of now). Just a\r\n        promise not backed by anything , but by government in good faith. The\r\n        money trust goes from being into something (gold), to someone (promise\r\n        by govt.) . Such a currency whose value is derived from promise only and\r\n        not from some valuable commodity is termed as fiat currency. US dollars\r\n        is a fiat currency not backed by gold , but only by a promise. Indian\r\n        Rupees is also a fiat currency.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        To establish order in financial institutions , institution called\r\n        Reserve bank came up. Reserve bank are also called federal reserve or\r\n        Central bank. Federal reserve was set up to monitor the various bank in\r\n        a country & regulate them. Banks are allowed to take money from federal\r\n        reserve , on an interest rate, so that they could lend that money as\r\n        loan to the bank customers. They have to pay back these loans that they\r\n        take from federal reserve at an pre-decided interest rate. In India,\r\n        Reserve bank of India (RBI) is the central bank which monitors all\r\n        Indian banks.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        When you deposit 100 rupees in bank, banks extends loans of more than\r\n        100 rupees at the cost of your 100 rupees and creates an extra 1000\r\n        Rupees in the system. If you deposit 100 rupees , you get an let’s say 6\r\n        % interest rate on it. The bank at the cost of your 100 rupees , issue\r\n        loans to another multiple persons to the amount greater than 100 Rupees.\r\n        Bank charges 12 % interest rates on loans given. In this way bank earn\r\n        profits for itself and you earn interest rate on your 100 rupees while\r\n        bank earn 12 % interest rate on loans. There is a set ratio set by\r\n        Central bank of each country. This ratio represent how much can a bank\r\n        lend out and how much reserve a bank has to keep with them at all times.\r\n        The ratio is called Reserve ratio. This system is called fractional\r\n        reserve banking system. Creation of money happens here.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        During the era of gold standard, a country needed to have as much gold\r\n        as it has money in circulation in the marketplace. After the world\r\n        abandoned the gold era, a country fed reserve don’t need anything to\r\n        back the money in marketplace with limited resources like gold.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Fed reserve has the power to print money. Fed reserve control the supply\r\n        of money of a country. It can print as much money as it wants . During\r\n        the gold era, fed reserve printed money equivalent to the gold value a\r\n        country had. After the gold era ended, fed reserve prints money out of\r\n        thin air whenever they want to. They are not liable or bounded by\r\n        limited gold anymore. Their money is not backed by anything , but only a\r\n        promise. You might begin to wonder that how can they just print money\r\n        out of thin air while we invest our time effort and energy to earn\r\n        money. In fact, the banks in 1933 printed so much money that currency in\r\n        circulation in marketplace was greater than the gold in the bank vault.\r\n        To solve this problem, the then President of US , Franklin D Roosevelt,\r\n        issued an order for public to surrender all the gold that public held\r\n        with themselves at that time and give to government so that they can\r\n        give it to banks.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        That’s not all, when bank uses fractional reserve system or fed reserve\r\n        print money out of thin air , your value of money or currency goes down.\r\n        Its purchasing power decreases or prices of goods and services go up.\r\n        This is called inflation. It’s simple demand and supply principle. When\r\n        in the marketplace , people have lots of cash , the value of that\r\n        currency goes down. Your 1 US dollar in 1990s might buy you a t-shirt.\r\n        But to buy that same t-shirt now you need to pay 5 US dollar. You can\r\n        buy few things with one dollar now. That’s because of inflation. When\r\n        cash is in excess in marketplace , people spend it in market to buy\r\n        goods and services. As goods and services are limited, or it takes time\r\n        to create goods & provide services , and supply of cash is high, people\r\n        fight for limited resources. Seeing this either the seller increase the\r\n        price as the good and service demand is high among people , and whoever\r\n        pays more can buy the sellers good and service so that he can make good\r\n        profit. Or people just compete with each other to get access to limited\r\n        goods and service and are willing to pay more to seller so that they can\r\n        outbid each other.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Imagine you are buying apples, there are only 5 apples in market as it\r\n        takes time to grow apples. And the next delivery of apples is not going\r\n        to be soon in the marketplace. Now you want these 5 apples , but in the\r\n        marketplace there are other also who want those 5 apples. The seller is\r\n        selling it at 1 US dollar. When people come to seller shop to buy\r\n        apples, seeing high demand and limited supply for apples, the seller\r\n        start selling it at 2 US dollars to maximize his profit in marketplace.\r\n        You make bid to sellers because you desperately want those apples. You\r\n        bid 2.5 US dollar and other person bid 3 US dollar because he also want\r\n        the same good as you want. In the end the seller sell the goods to those\r\n        who bids higher . And people are willing to bid higher, because people\r\n        have cash with them. In reality cost price are decided by sellers only ,\r\n        not buyers. This example is taken only to illustrate and make you\r\n        understand about inflation and demand and supply and processing.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        When I was a teenager, I used to go to coaching classes. I used to hail\r\n        Rickshaw to go from my home to the classes. I used to switch Rickshaw\r\n        from one Auto stand to another Auto stand as it was cheaper and Rickshaw\r\n        charged less when they used to get a “full sawari”. It happened one time\r\n        that police raids took place on Auto stand and they were rounding up\r\n        Auto rickshaw and confiscated their vehicles for taking on full sawari.\r\n        So at one Auto stand on that day there was a plethora of crowd of people\r\n        and few Auto rickshaws. On any given day for travelling 4 km, Auto\r\n        rickshaw used to charge 12 rupees, on that day when rickshaw were few\r\n        and crowd was large , Rickshaw started to charge 14 -15 rupees. I myself\r\n        was saved that day when my father saw me in the crowd and I went home\r\n        with him. This is another demand-supply-processing phenomena in action.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another instances that I would like to give is, Prime Minister Narendra\r\n        Modi announced a lockdown in India to prevent the spread of COVID- 19 in\r\n        India. At that time people rushed to buy vegetables and fruits from the\r\n        open market. Seeing this sudden demand , the sellers sold the vegetable\r\n        and fruits at higher prices, and sellers whole stock got sold pretty\r\n        quickly. This was also demand-supply-processing phenomena in action.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The more cash there is in marketplace , or the more fiat currency is\r\n        there in marketplace , this demand supply and processing phenomena come\r\n        into effect and prices rises. Having excess of money in market lower its\r\n        purchasing power. So when the Fed reserve of USA prints money out of\r\n        thin air, they are infusing the American economy with “funny money”. The\r\n        more they print money and the more bank uses fractional reserve system\r\n        of banking, you get poorer because inflation increases and your money\r\n        purchasing power decreases. Inflation is a silent tax. Those who are\r\n        saving money are actually getting poorer because of inflation. Inflation\r\n        figures are given by and calculated either by government or fed reserve.\r\n        The purchasing power of dollar has actually decreased after 1971. The\r\n        fed reserve has printed money out of thin air to compensate for 2008\r\n        economic crisis , or savings and loan crisis of 1987 in America. They\r\n        have even announced an stimulus package for markets affected due to\r\n        coronavirus. They are infusing more and more money , created out of thin\r\n        air and infusing it in the market. If they continue doing this then they\r\n        might reach a depression as was seen in Germany after World War 1 when\r\n        Germany was asked by other countries to compensate the bills for war to\r\n        other countries. At the time , the German fed reserve printed lots of\r\n        money which devalued the German currency at that time. The strategy that\r\n        Germany used at that time to pay war reparations was the mass printing\r\n        of bank notes to buy foreign currency, which was then used to pay\r\n        reparations, but this strategy greatly exacerbated the inflation of the\r\n        Papiermarks ( the German paper currency of that time). People had to\r\n        take carts filled with money to buy bread. It recently happened in\r\n        Venezuela . It happened also in Zimbabwe where the government decided to\r\n        adopt US dollars as their currency, after, their initial currency\r\n        devalued and crashed. It happened in Argentina. History shows that every\r\n        fiat currency has come down to its original value of zero. When a\r\n        currency crashes or gets devalued , in that country hyperinflation sets\r\n        in. Hyperinflation is a condition where the prices of goods and services\r\n        rises phenomenally and at a very fast rate making it difficult for\r\n        people to make transaction.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        US dollar is registered as the currency of the world. After the Bretton\r\n        woods agreement, the world decided that the dollar would be backed by\r\n        gold, and all other currencies of the world would be linked to dollar.\r\n        Some countries like, France, began to trade their dollar for the gold.\r\n        Seeing this, all the other countries joined France. In this case ,\r\n        America was the bank, and the rest of the country were its customers,\r\n        and now everybody at the same time came to the bank to claim their gold.\r\n        America Gold resources depleted quickly. To prevent depletion of gold\r\n        and the to save themselves from the bank run, in 1971 the dollar was put\r\n        out of the gold standard. Now no country can claim gold for their\r\n        dollar. And America can now just issue bonds (explain later in this\r\n        book) to pay its bill. The greatest export of America in the recent\r\n        times is inflation. Trade in international market happens in Dollar. If\r\n        the Dollar becomes devalued, then the world would abandon the Dollar as\r\n        the world currency. What that means is that the world would move on to\r\n        any other currency. And when that happens , The American economy would\r\n        collapse. When it does , it will take the world economy with it ,\r\n        including India, because we are very interconnected nowadays. India\r\n        would be impacted but not that much. This scenario is discussed in\r\n        detail in this book. But still it will cause a economic shock. In 2008\r\n        economic crisis , the then Prime Minister Of India bought gold against\r\n        Dollars.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Fed reserve or the central bank of an country set an interest rate to\r\n        banks at which , the banks take loans from the fed reserve. Here the fed\r\n        act like depositor , but the fed decided the interest rates not the\r\n        bank. Then the bank gives out loan in marketplace higher to that\r\n        interest rate so as to earn money and also uses fractional reserve\r\n        banking system to create profit for themselves. So if fed charges an\r\n        interest rate of say 3 % on the loans taken by banks, the bank would\r\n        charge say 6% to the customers of bank.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Just as there is inflation, there is deflation. Deflation is Opposite to\r\n        inflation where price of goods and services gets cheap because demand in\r\n        market is low & supply of good and services is high.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If the fed see that people are spending less in market , as happens for\r\n        example in economic crashes in recession or depression , or during\r\n        deflationary periods, what fed do is lower the interest rates so as\r\n        banks can give loan in market place for less interest rate. What this\r\n        does is, it stimulate demands for goods and services so as companies\r\n        don’t go bankrupt . Many economist think that control inflation is good\r\n        for economic growth of a country. As the interest rates become lower\r\n        people take loans , and spend in marketplace , stimulating growth in the\r\n        economy.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If the inflation is too high ( as was during the era of Former Indian PM\r\n        Manmohan Singh tenure in India) the fed may take steps to control it.\r\n        Often by increasing interest rate , or by other alternative solutions.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Why am I telling you all this? What’s all this has got to do with you?\r\n        Why should you be concerned with all this? This is important so as you\r\n        can understand what’s happening in market and what effect it is going to\r\n        have on your money or personal finance. In every market crash ,\r\n        recession & depression , large amount of exchange of money takes place\r\n        often to those, who knows how to make money even in depression or during\r\n        recession . During market crash , many investment avenues are available\r\n        for an investor to buy asset at cheap prices. As the market recovers\r\n        from that depression or recession , the investment avenues also grows\r\n        with the market and come back to its original price before the market\r\n        crashed. So if you have high financial intelligence you can use the time\r\n        of depression or recession to make profit. I am also telling you this so\r\n        as you can protect yourself from inflation. The aim of doing investment\r\n        is yes to make profit, but also to beat inflation. I am also writing\r\n        this so as you can understand the factors that affect investment avenue\r\n        and your money directly or indirectly and you can be wise enough to read\r\n        the chart and find value in it. This reading now would be helpful for\r\n        you to understand how this co-relate to various factors and how your\r\n        money could or is affected by it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Banks and institutions wants you to remain in debt , because that’s how\r\n        they earn profit. I write all this so you become smart enough to not get\r\n        into debt. And even if you are in debt , you can come out of it using\r\n        your financial intelligence . For example , as a start, stop using\r\n        credit card. They keep you in debt . it’s a very useless financial\r\n        product by which I end up paying more than cost of the products I own\r\n        and have bought using that credit card. Credit card induces a mind-set\r\n        of buy now pay later. This mind-set is not a good financial behaviour.\r\n        It burdens a person with obligation to pay the credit card issuer. And\r\n        by chance if you missed the repayment credit holdings, then they will\r\n        charge insanely to you. Credit card keeps me in debt so using my\r\n        financial intelligence and IQ I stop using credit card and stop paying\r\n        unnecessary interest rate, fees and tax on my usage. Instead of paying\r\n        for things which I cannot afford by using my credit card, I use my\r\n        financial intelligence to look for ways to increase my stream of income\r\n        and increase my asset which pays for my liabilities . Instead of owning\r\n        money to credit card issuer I want to instead focus on using that money\r\n        to invest in assets. The mind-set is of increasing your means of living,\r\n        not choosing the easy way out by using credit card. Credit card are\r\n        useful if a person is using it wisely and in discipline way, but many\r\n        people use credit card foolishly and ends up deteriorating their\r\n        financial budget.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        For example if I wanted a nice costly Electric car let’s say, I would\r\n        need to create asset for myself which pays for my liability of first,\r\n        buy the car and 2nd maintaining it by charging it. I would first create\r\n        asset that generate enough money for me to buy the car, and then I would\r\n        install solar panels in my home so that it covers my car charging\r\n        liability. I invest in solar panel only once, and it give me profit\r\n        repeatedly (it saves me money). This is all what financial intelligence\r\n        is all about. I will not take a loan and get in debt with the bank to\r\n        pay for a car that goes down in value with time and also cost me money\r\n        to maintain it again and again and makes me poor. I will look for ways\r\n        so that my asset pays for my liabilities.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So the question arises, what are asset and how do you create assets for\r\n        yourself?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
