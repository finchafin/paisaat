Along with that , real estate is\r\n        the most fraudulent marketplace. In real estate , an investor invest in\r\n        hard tangible asset such as , residential property &amp; commercial\r\n        property.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Investors in real estate enjoy Control of price of asset. A term that\r\n        will be described shortly. Also real estate investment requires huge\r\n        capital and generally has liquidity crunch.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        In real estate , the position or location of the asset is very\r\n        important. You must look for a position or location where people are\r\n        moving . As where the people are moving, there demands for housing will\r\n        be up and hence prices will rise there.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Before understanding real estate , I want you to understand the\r\n        important difference between capital gains and cash flow.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Capital gains is realized at an instant of time. While cash flow is\r\n        realized over a period of time.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If you buy a property and its price move up in due time, and you sell\r\n        that property and create a profit then this is called earning capital\r\n        gains on your asset or property in this case. You realize capital gains\r\n        all the time in stock market.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If you buy a property and put it up for rent for other people , you will\r\n        get a monthly return out of your asset. This is called cash flow. You\r\n        can earn cash flow in stock market only through dividend .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Which is wiser in real estate? Capital gains or rental income?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Experts of real estate investors says that one must invest in real\r\n        estate to realize cash flow or rental income. Let’s see why.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        When you buy a property to realize capital gains, you can only gain ONCE\r\n        out of it. If you buy property to have a repeated source of income, then\r\n        you can realize gain monthly and repeatedly. So it’s better to have\r\n        assets pay you repeatedly . Finding new investment opportunities is\r\n        quarrelsome and tedious process. It’s much better to have a repeated\r\n        source of income from your current asset then to go out and find new\r\n        asset every now and then.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        But this does not mean that you don’t invest for capital gains, if you\r\n        think the conditions and environment is beneficial for capital gains ,\r\n        then you can invest in real estate for capital gains.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        When you asses a property for real estate investment purpose, keep in\r\n        mind that your house in which you live is not an asset. Rather , your\r\n        house is a liability as you need to pay money to keep it maintained. And\r\n        if you are taking on a liability, make sure you have the asset to pay\r\n        for it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        What makes a real estate property good investment? These things :-\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{ marginLeft: \"50px\" }}>\r\n        1) The position or location of the property <br />\r\n        2) Property management skills <br />\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        When you are searching for a real estate property to buy, you need to\r\n        asses whether the positions or location of the property is good or not.\r\n        For example if you go to Mumbai real estate , the house prices there are\r\n        far more for the same sq. feet of land when compare with a house in a\r\n        tier 2 city like Surat or any other city. That’s because there is so\r\n        much public in Mumbai , which has risen the demand for housing. Buy\r\n        property where people are moving to. Read the trends and analyse which\r\n        location is best for your real estate investment. Where there is public,\r\n        there is automatically rising demand of housing and an opportunity for\r\n        real estate investors to invest.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another example is if you are looking in a city, try to find a real\r\n        estate property near the area where jobs are high. People tend to buy or\r\n        rent a house that’s closer to their office address . So if you find a\r\n        real estate investment which is closer to the area of a city where jobs\r\n        happens , then that area real estate demand would be high ,which would\r\n        lead to increase in prices and more opportunity for you to rent houses.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The second skill is that of property management skills. While searching\r\n        for real estate property to buy, you will come across some property\r\n        which is in good location but are neglected. These houses are in good\r\n        location but their maintenance would be poor. For example they might\r\n        have broken windows and poorly maintained pipes or sewage supplies, old\r\n        paint job, etc. These house are available to buy for cheap prices. You\r\n        can buy them and then renovate the whole house. In this process , your\r\n        property management skills would come into use. Real estate is\r\n        intensively property management. Many investors buy such houses , and\r\n        the renovate it and sell it at higher prices after inflating the house\r\n        prices. Cause why not , they did renovate the house and now they have\r\n        risen the prices to create profit.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        But you can buy real estate property if you have money to buy. The\r\n        property doesn’t come cheaper than 30 lakhs or so. How are you going to\r\n        find so much money to buy real estate property. That’s why I said real\r\n        estate is the big league player. It is capital intensive. But there is a\r\n        solution which is discussed later in this chapter where you can own real\r\n        estates (but in percentages , like stocks) if you don’t have 30 lakhs or\r\n        that much amount of money to buy properties.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        There is a difference in real estate and stock market. This difference\r\n        in real estate is because of a term called “ Control of price of asset”\r\n        . Real estate has high degree of Control of price of asset. Control of\r\n        price of asset is a term which means that the price of asset can be\r\n        decided by the investor who owns such asset. In stock market, an\r\n        investor cannot control prices of a stock. But in real estate , an\r\n        investor can control the price of its real estate property. At which\r\n        price to sell , at which price to buy (through negotiation and\r\n        bargaining ). Unlike in stock market, real estate investor has this\r\n        advantage of control.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        While you are buying real estate property , always keep in mind of home\r\n        insurance so in the event of natural disaster like earthquake or\r\n        tsunami, your asset if get destroyed , can be insured against that.\r\n        Before buying real estate do keep a check on property strength and\r\n        resilience and whether the property is built with all the latest\r\n        standard of safety measures.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another important skill that you will need is of negotiating skills. You\r\n        have to negotiate toughly when putting a deal for buying real estate. So\r\n        develop your negotiation skills. Learn to value a real estate property\r\n        as per your analysis. Write down those points of analysis and use them\r\n        as arguments for negotiating with the seller of real estate property as\r\n        to why you think that the seller is overpricing the property, if he is\r\n        doing that.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Real estate properties are a good investment property in that they give\r\n        high Control of price of asset to investors and are used as a hedge\r\n        against inflation by many investors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        There are many frauds that happen in this market. Let’s discuss some of\r\n        them.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The real estate investment is divided into 3 parts. Pre-construction ,\r\n        during construction and post construction or move-in ready investments.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Pre-construction investment is when the builder or developer hasn’t\r\n        start building the real estate property and only has bought land to\r\n        develop one. A builder can reach out to investors (you) and promise you\r\n        a flat or home at lower price or at discount rate. The builder or\r\n        developer can also offer you a 10-12% assured returns after you invest\r\n        in such schemes of him. The builder or developer is doing all this\r\n        because he has no money to create a real estate property and he is\r\n        either taking loan from banks to create one or from investors who are\r\n        investing or buying their homes or residential property.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The builder what he does is, pay only 10% of the value of land to the\r\n        land seller who is selling land to the builder. Not the full cost of the\r\n        land, only a part of it (sort of like down payment). Then he creates a\r\n        brochure and pamphlets or other related things and sell it in market and\r\n        start doing pre-sales tactics. The investment that he will receive via\r\n        this route, he will use this money to pay the full amount to land owner.\r\n        Doing such financial juggad, the project always faces delays and the\r\n        builder might have promised you your investment in let’s say 20 months\r\n        but the project now gets delays to more than 20 months. The investors\r\n        are sitting duck and just can’t do anything as their money is stuck in\r\n        this investment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Or what he will do is shows that he own 10 hectare land when only he\r\n        owns 8 hectare land. This is termed as “land encroachment”. Problems\r\n        arise when you can’t get necessary certificates from authorities\r\n        afterwards which are required to establish your ownership legally. You\r\n        will face difficulties.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Or what would happen is that he sell you the land that he does not own.\r\n        He will forged fake documents and would claim ownership , but when you\r\n        check for in details and for real, you would get to know that he is\r\n        selling someone else land and is duping you. I remember this famous\r\n        Gujarati comedian who directed a picture in Guajarati. The character in\r\n        it is selling a piece of land to a investor that he does not own. At the\r\n        time of auctioning of land the police comes and close down the\r\n        auctioning going on and the investor starts chasing the character. It\r\n        was meant to be a funny circumstance setting but it’s not funny in real\r\n        life.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The second phase is during construction. The builder has started\r\n        developing the estate and is now selling the estate to raise funds.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If an investors go and buy during such phase, again the builder would\r\n        provide a timeline to the investors and would assured him of delivering\r\n        before such and such date. If an investor invests his money during such\r\n        phase, the builder buys more lands with investor money rather than focus\r\n        on developing estate. This leads to delay delivery and again investor\r\n        money stuck in projects and wasted. The idea for builder to do such a\r\n        thing is when the real estate market is going upwards (prices are rising\r\n        continuously) the builder hopes to buy lands from investor money and\r\n        sell it at higher prices to earn profit. If the real estate market goes\r\n        down, then the builder loses his investor money too.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        During such phase when the construction is near to completion, the\r\n        builder sees that those investors who had invested early in this\r\n        project, or during the early phase of construction got the estate at\r\n        cheap prices. Now the same real estate is valued more in the market.\r\n        People who had invested in the project at initial days and they have\r\n        been promised a unit in less amount ,later when property rates are high\r\n        compared to the previous rates developers would be trying to cancel all\r\n        units which were sold previously in low rates just to gain more and more\r\n        profits.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        This could happen in case of late instalment payment by buyers or\r\n        builder will delay projects date purposely due to which old investors\r\n        will cancel their units and will take their money back.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The same units will be then sold to another buyer at high price.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another very common scam is that real estate developer or builder would\r\n        take money from investors but won’t complete or give the real estate\r\n        property in time and would purposely drag on the project leaving\r\n        investor money stuck in the project and leaving them powerless to do\r\n        anything.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        3rd phase is post-construction or ready to move in residential real\r\n        estate. The most common scam in this phase is termed as “Title fraud”.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The builder or developer won’t even own a real estate but would forge\r\n        documents to show that he owns them and would sell the real estate\r\n        property that he does not own, in the open market. This would lead to\r\n        investors getting duped by such cheaters and scammers. Or what would\r\n        happen is that the builder or developer would sell the same title of\r\n        land to multiple buyers and then run away taking money of all these\r\n        investors, leaving behind buyers who will fight it out in the Courts to\r\n        establish their ownership of the land.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Real estate developers would lie to the buyers or investors that only\r\n        2-3 flats are remaining and if they don’t invest in this flat or real\r\n        estate property , then this opportunity would go away from them. This is\r\n        an outright lie, and one must never fall into this. They tell this lie\r\n        because they want to sell the land as quickly as possible to the buyer ,\r\n        and in the rush they will make you sign agreement and papers which will\r\n        rip you apart. They will make your life hell and your money wasted.\r\n        Never ever ever sign something in rush. Never go into a real estate deal\r\n        in rush ever. Always keep a cool mind and invest with cool mind. Analyse\r\n        EVERYTHING before investing in real estate.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another scam is that the builders or real estate developers would write\r\n        house size more than it is in reality. For example, on legal papers it\r\n        is written that the bedroom size is say 110 sq. feet., but when you\r\n        actually visit the site it will be 90 sq. feet or less.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The builder would promise investor or buyers something else in brochure\r\n        and would provide something else in reality. For example, they might\r\n        have showed a nice washing basin in brochure , but in reality they would\r\n        install a 2nd class wash basin whose tap might leak. In one rainy\r\n        season, the roof will start to leak and water would enter the house as\r\n        its poor quality construction.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Then builder would also sell lower quality of construction to the\r\n        investors. If an investors gets impressed by advertisement and brochures\r\n        and views from estate ,etc and does not check the underlying details of\r\n        the real estate property, then he will end up owning a sub-standard poor\r\n        quality constructed house. Outside, everything would look safe and\r\n        beautiful, but once you go into details, you will realize the scam and\r\n        the ugliness of the deal. Real estate developers or builders often in\r\n        this garb of outside beauty and finished decorations hide their many\r\n        scams and frauds. Never ever be so swayed away by the outside things,\r\n        that you don’t check in detail the inside ugliness of the deal.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another scam is that a government certificate is required which is\r\n        termed “change of land use (CLU)”. When a builder buys agricultural\r\n        land, he has to acquire CLU certificate from competent authorities as\r\n        only after that it will be fully legal. Many developers don’t acquire\r\n        such certificates and left investors in lurch yet again.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Many legalities are left incomplete which makes the experience of buying\r\n        home bad for the investors or buyers. When investing in real estate ,\r\n        always ask for all legal documents and double check them. Also check\r\n        that they are not fraudulent papers. Do a solid background check on the\r\n        builder or real estate developer. Ask other person who have invested\r\n        before you how their experience has been with the particular developer\r\n        or builder.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        They will try to rush the deal and in this rushness would make you sign\r\n        papers and legal agreements and contract that you did not even read, and\r\n        then they will take away all your legal rights and your chance of\r\n        fighting back if a scam happens with you. They do this on purpose. They\r\n        will make such legal agreements that as an investors you would not be\r\n        even aware of them and they will cut your both wings so as even if they\r\n        do fraud, you cannot do anything about it. When investing in real estate\r\n        , never sign on anything without reading. Make this your mantra,\r\n        whatever promises a builder or real estate developer does, let it be in\r\n        writing and in proper legal forms. Always read very carefully\r\n        everything, before you sign on anything.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        It is much better if you take lawyer with you when investing in real\r\n        estate properties.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        It is much better to invest in post construction property , rather than\r\n        in pre & during or under- construction properties. You can invest in\r\n        under-construction property but only if that is registered with RERA\r\n        (explain later) with all due legal requirements and you can handle all\r\n        the shrewdness and scams that they will try to pull on you. Don’t be\r\n        egoistic and think that you know it all, you don’t. Always study and do\r\n        detail analysis. Take the help of lawyers and financial accountant.\r\n        Never assume you know. Even if you are investing in completed\r\n        properties, always carry out detail analysis, never let anything go.\r\n        It’s much better to not be an expert in investment than to act as a\r\n        novice and protect yourself from scams.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        There are so many scams that happens in real estate and it is very\r\n        important to use your financial IQ to protect yourself from such\r\n        financial predators.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Just Google search financial fraud in India, you will see what is the\r\n        condition of the market is, and that is also why the reputation of\r\n        builders and real estate developers is low in society.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        However I will like to point out that not all real estate developers are\r\n        bad and not every builder is bad. There are still many good real estate\r\n        investors and builders out there who work honestly and earns honestly.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Real estate market before 2016 was an unregulated market. What that\r\n        means is, as for stock market there is SEBI, which regulates the stock\r\n        market of India & make rules or regulations to protect investors from\r\n        scam, as there is Fed reserve or Reserve bank of India to regulate and\r\n        safeguard the interest of all in the financial system of banking, in\r\n        real estate there was no such authority prior to 2016.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Seeing such massive frauds and cheating happening in this market, in\r\n        2016 the Modi government passed a bill in the Parliament of India to\r\n        authorise and set up a body called RERA-Real estate regulatory\r\n        Authority. RERA is a landmark (literally☺) bill in the real estate\r\n        investment and really provides a sigh of relief to real estate\r\n        investors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Now every real estate project is mandatory to register with RERA before\r\n        selling or marketing the real estate property. RERA makes the real\r\n        estate investment transparent and convenient for investors and buyers.\r\n        For any real estate project comprising of a land area greater than 500\r\n        square metres (approx., 5,380 square feet) or 8 apartments, it is now\r\n        compulsory to get registered with RERA before the launch. RERA mandates\r\n        all real estate developers and builders to update the details of their\r\n        projects on a quarterly basis. RERA mandates promoters to disclose the\r\n        clear title of the project and the property. This is a crucial step that\r\n        has been taken to protect the interest of home buyers. In case of any\r\n        discrepancy found in the property title, the investor can ask for a\r\n        compensation of which there is no upper limit. And there is much more in\r\n        RERA which makes it convenient for buyers and investors and bring\r\n        transparency to system to protect them from scams and frauds.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So in the future if you are investing, you can go to RERA site and check\r\n        everything for yourself. The status of the project, its legalities, its\r\n        builder reputation, how many cases are there on the builder or estate\r\n        developer, etc. RERA has made real estate investing easy and\r\n        transparent. Make full use of it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        After you have bought a property you have to look for tenant - A person\r\n        who will pay rent which is cumbersome. Finding a good tenant is\r\n        difficult. Plus you have to deal with the scams and shrewdness of\r\n        builders and developers. Also someone who is on his journey towards\r\n        financial independence and who does not have large sums of money, how\r\n        can they invest in real estate? Is there some another way where you can\r\n        invest in real estate without investing lakhs of rupees? Yes there is.\r\n        REIT – Real estate investment trust provides an opportunity for doing\r\n        just that. Along with REIT there is also INvIT- Infrastructure\r\n        investment trust. Let’s see what they are.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p variant=\"h5\">REIT – Real Estate Investment Trust</p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        REIT is kind of mutual funds of Real estate. Just as in a mutual fund,\r\n        investors money are pool together and invested in stock market, In REIT\r\n        , investors pool their money and REIT invest in commercial property-\r\n        office space, malls, hotels- to earn rental income through them and give\r\n        it to investors. REIT earns income via renting and earning interest.\r\n        There are two types of REIT, one is termed as equity REIT and other is\r\n        termed as Mortgage REIT.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The REIT collects funds from investors and then invests that money to\r\n        buy property which provides rental income. REIT can also sell these\r\n        properties anytime. REIT invest in commercial property like malls,\r\n        office rents ,etc.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        REIT provides an excellent opportunity for an investor to diversify its\r\n        portfolio (something which is discussed in detail later.) REIT issues\r\n        shares just like in stock market. These shares are issued to investors\r\n        and the rental income can be earned by investors through Share Dividend\r\n        that is declared by REIT. By law, REIT are mandated to share 90% of\r\n        their profit as share dividend. The stocks of REIT does not grow fast.\r\n        If you are looking for capital gains, don’t invest in REIT. Use REIT to\r\n        gain fixed income asset and to maintain liquidity in your investment\r\n        portfolio.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The advantage of REIT is that you can invest directly in real estate\r\n        without doing anything like, going out to deal with builder or real\r\n        estate developers or managing the property or finding a tenant. All of\r\n        this is eliminated. You just buy stocks of REIT , earn fixed rental\r\n        income via dividend share that are announced semi-annually or quarterly\r\n        (depends). And you are done, no wastage of time.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The cons of REIT is that it comes under taxable income (optional).\r\n        Budget 2020 of India presented entity and organisations and trusts with\r\n        2 options. Prior to 2020, there was only one option. Let’s name this\r\n        before 2020 tax option as old tax regime. And after 2020 tax regime\r\n        let’s call it new tax regime. Now according to old tax regime, it is the\r\n        company or organisation which has to pay tax and investor who gets\r\n        dividend does not pay tax. According to new tax regime, the government\r\n        gave an option to organisation that they can lower their paying tax rate\r\n        to around 25%, which is lower than what they pay in old tax regime which\r\n        was 30% and around it. But doing so , the investor who gets dividend\r\n        will get taxed. So it depends on an organisation, what tax regime they\r\n        have chosen & according to that whether you will get taxed or not is\r\n        decided. This is at the time of 2020 Year and if any changes happen in\r\n        tax laws then you got to stay updated about that.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another con is you have to pay charges like maintenance fees to the\r\n        promoters of REIT.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Don’t invest in Real estate for capital gains, invest in real estate for\r\n        cash flow.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        REIT is regulated by SEBI, not RERA. REIT shares are bought in lot\r\n        (Recall derivative market).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Currently SEBI has allowed 200 units minimum in lot which has to be\r\n        bought. A minimum investment of Rs.50,000 is needed by an investor to\r\n        invest in REIT.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        REIT are of two types, one which earns income on rental (Equity REIT)\r\n        and 2nd which earns income on interest (Mortgage REIT).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Equity REIT: - A trust pools money of investors and buy properties and\r\n        give it on rent. The rent earned is shared through dividend among\r\n        investors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Mortgage REIT: - A trust pools money of Investors and buy Mortgage\r\n        backed securities (term not explained and discussed in this book), and\r\n        other related asset and provide loans to real estate developer to\r\n        complete their project and earns an interest on it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Mortgage: - A term which means money that one borrow in order to buy a\r\n        house or flat.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        REIT gives money or loans to various builders and real estate developers\r\n        for project completion, as the REIT is handled by professionals and is\r\n        regulated by SEBI, it makes it much safer as compared to when you\r\n        yourself go out and buy real estate. And by giving loans they earn\r\n        interest on that loans and share it with investors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        It was said that during COVID-19 as work from home culture became\r\n        popular, the REIT prices collapsed in stock market and some investors\r\n        asked that whether work from home is something that will become\r\n        permanent? If yes then from where will the income of REIT in future\r\n        would come from. Well I don’t think work from home would become\r\n        permanent , people want a change of environment while they are at work\r\n        and while they are at home. So it still is a not a viable proposition.\r\n        Also with the rise of Airbnb and rent a place & other things like that\r\n        are becoming popular then it can have affect if the REIT are invested in\r\n        places like hotels. Still hotels would also remain popular and REIT\r\n        faces no possible NEARBY threat from all this. In fact, the market for\r\n        REIT is largely untapped by retail investors. To promote REIT investment\r\n        in retail segment of Investors, government first did not tax REIT\r\n        dividend income. It was only in budget 2020 of India that this was\r\n        proposed, as the first REIT of India whose IPO was declared in 2019 saw\r\n        a oversubscription of 2.5 times. Majority of proportion of REIT are hold\r\n        by institutional investors. The first REIT in India was of Embassy.\r\n        Another REIT whose IPO came in 2020 was Mindspace. These are the\r\n        currently only 2 REIT in India.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        REIT is not as volatile as the stock market normally is. It also\r\n        provides protection to investors against this volatility of stock market\r\n        and give assured steady returns to investors, hence it is a investment\r\n        to look out for establishing cash flow and liquidity.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Even though REIT eliminates all of the things that you as an investor in\r\n        real estate properties needs to keep in mind (finding a tenant, managing\r\n        the property, etc which actually is a huge burden off your chest) & also\r\n        protects you from scams and frauds that happens in real estate, you\r\n        still need to evaluate the REIT trust. Check out its financial health,\r\n        who is managing it, how has the trust performed in past and all other\r\n        things. Check out its statics ,etc. Check for yourself and evaluate a\r\n        trust based on that and then invest. Don’t invest blindly.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p variant=\"h5\">\r\n        INvIT- Infrastructure investment Trust\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        INvIT is similar to REIT but differentiate in as that INvIT invest in\r\n        infrastructure rather than in Real estate. What that means is that INvIT\r\n        invest in Projects like solar plants, building highway, building telecom\r\n        towers and other infrastructure projects like PPP(public private\r\n        partnership, it means government and private companies have worked\r\n        together) like model of Airport construction ,etc. Then out of this\r\n        revenue comes and this revenue is given to shareholders in the form of\r\n        dividend. The minimum investment that is needed in INvIT is Rs. 1 lakh.\r\n        All other things are same as happens in REIT (although the management\r\n        structure of such trust is different). Let’s see the pros and cons of\r\n        INvIT .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Pros of INvIT are that it has more liquidity compare to REIT. It is a\r\n        good option if an investor is looking to have liquidity in his\r\n        portfolio.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Cons is that it has risk of regulatory intervention by the government\r\n        which might produce lower returns for an investors. Also high rate of\r\n        inflation can increase the operational cost of asset in INvIT and this\r\n        can lead to decrease profit for investors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        All in all , real estate properties are a good investment for hedge\r\n        against inflation and they are a good asset for generating cash flow.\r\n        They are also good option for diversification. Due care needs to be\r\n        taken when investing in real estate. One can use REIT to invest in real\r\n        estate without taking any responsibility of real estate property. INvIT\r\n        provides an investor to earn through investment in Infrastructure\r\n        projects.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p variant=\"h5\">Rent Vs. EMI (buy)</p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        What makes more sense , to rent or to buy home with loans EMI (Equated\r\n        monthly instalment , a sort of monthly payment program when you buy home\r\n        via bank loans) . Well that answer depends, depends on you and your\r\n        needs.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        For example if you are a bachelor and young , like if you are in the age\r\n        group of 20-26 or 27 , then that is the age where you can live a frugal\r\n        and changing lifestyle and adapt quickly to various different\r\n        circumstances and environments. So I suggest that you can rent house at\r\n        this age and with the money you save by renting, you can invest that to\r\n        build your assets.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        At this age , what you can do is rent 3bhk flats or plots. What you have\r\n        to do is look for such properties to rent for yourself. Look for cheap\r\n        rents and quality housing. And when you are finalising the deal with the\r\n        owner of that house , include a clause or negotiate with the owner of\r\n        the house that you can rent these rooms to others. Now you have 3BHK\r\n        property as a rent. Lets assume that the rent of the 3BHK per month is\r\n        20,000 Rupees. What you do is you take one Bedroom for yourself, and\r\n        rent the other 2 bedrooms to people for rent , where you will take the\r\n        rent from them. You can set the rent prices of those 2 bedrooms. What\r\n        will this do is it will cut your rent cost, making more money available\r\n        for you to build asset or use that money to build your business. For\r\n        example, lets say you decide to rent those 2 bedrooms at say 6,666\r\n        Rupees each. In total you are getting 13,332 Rupees via those 2 rooms.\r\n        The rest of the rent you can pay with your own pocket which comes to out\r\n        to be around 6,666 Rupees. Now if you would have taken a 2 BHK flat it\r\n        will have cost you perhaps 15,000 Rupees (around this rate). Also\r\n        remember that if you are in tier 1 cities , then the renting cost is\r\n        high and you have to pay more. With this way you can save money, and\r\n        with this save money you can invest in you asset building or invest that\r\n        amount in your company. This age is the age where you can adapt to\r\n        changing times as you build a career for yourself, so its much better to\r\n        be versatile and dynamic with yourself. You can embrace the change\r\n        quickly and adapt according to it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Now if you are at say 30 years of age, and you want to settle down in\r\n        life because now with time you are looking beyond your career and career\r\n        is now not your priority, then you can settle for house to buy via bank\r\n        loans. When you take loans from banks , you have to pay EMI. EMI are\r\n        more in amounts/month than rent. But it provides stability if you are\r\n        done with job transfers and changing jobs or from the volatility of\r\n        market or your business. Now you have decided to settle in a particular\r\n        city for a long time. But at the same time always keep in mind, that no\r\n        matter what happens in the future, you have to pay your EMI. What do I\r\n        mean by that statement? What I mean is that, if due to unfortunate\r\n        circumstances you lose your job and can not find another job and become\r\n        unemployed or your business went bankrupt then also you have to keep\r\n        paying EMI. At such a scenario , if you are unable to pay EMI because\r\n        you are jobless or without a business , then the bank will take\r\n        possession of your house. You will be homeless. So always keep this\r\n        thing in the back of your mind.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Bank charges interest on loan per year , not per amount. What I mean is\r\n        by that is that the loan that you pay to the bank, in it a percentage of\r\n        amount does not go towards repayment of your principal but payment of\r\n        your interest on the principal. What that means is that you might be\r\n        paying the banks for 2 years, monthly EMI, but your repayment of\r\n        principal would be fraction of that amount. You had been paying interest\r\n        majorly. Now to decrease this interest on the principal amount, use the\r\n        concept of Pre-payment of loan excessively. Pre-payment of loan means\r\n        that if your EMI for a month is say 35,000 , then you pay the bank\r\n        40,000 or 45,000 instead. What this would do is decreases your principal\r\n        quickly and the interest on that quickly. This will help you in get rid\r\n        of any excess of money that you end up paying in the interest on your\r\n        loan. This will also help you to get rid of loan as quickly as possible.\r\n        If you were wise, and you save money in your 20s , and build your assets\r\n        then that assets too can pay for your loans. Its all about how you use\r\n        your time and money to build a financial freedom base for yourself. And\r\n        to do that effectively, you need to develop your financial intelligence,\r\n        IQ and literacy. You need to be financially empower.
