There is no logic and basis in trading. What people do in trading is they just guess which company stock is going to go up today and buy those shares in the hope of selling it at higher prices.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      What happens in Stock market is that , the prices of Shares keep on changing every second . People buys those shares in the hope that the price of the particular stock would increase so that they can sell these stocks to other in stock market and create or earn a profit from it .\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      Many people analyse the stock price before buying. They check how the price has been performing in the past couples of days , weeks and month , and then they predict or guess based on that data which stock price would go up today , so they buy those stock. This analysis of stock prices performance of past couples of days week and months and then betting in the stock market is called technical analysis. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      If a trader buys and sells shares in the same day, then that trade is called intraday trading.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      People invented things like “Futures contract” and “options contract” for trading. They both together are called “Derivatives “. What are futures contract and options contract? \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      To begin with, Stock Market is divided into two segments. First is called Cash market . 2nd is called Derivative market. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      In cash market , an investor can buy even 1 share of the company. Imagine if a company issue 200 shares , out of that an investor can buy only 1 shares if he wants to.  In cash market , the shareholder are eligible for benefits like Dividend and bonuses that company announces. Dividend is just the amount of money that company shares with its shareholder on a timely basis. Dividend pays you money as an investor, just by you holding the shares of a company. Company pays dividend to make their company more valuable as stock who give dividend ( Not all stock or company give dividend, company decide whether to give or not) are more in demand in stock market by investors.  In cash market, you can buy and own stocks and become a part owner on the company you invest in.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      In Derivative market , if you are buying a company shares, then you cannot buy only 1 shares of the company. You have to buy in lots. You have to buy 100 shares of the company in lot. In this you are not eligible if company announces dividend or bonuses.  Also in derivative markets the deals that you make have an expiry date. It can be weekly expiry date or monthly expiry date. You can book deals for the subsequent months too. For example if at present, August month is running, you can book a deal for the month of September in August only. Such things are not available in cash market. Derivative market consists of future contracts and option contracts. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n\r\n      Let’s see how in various ways, people use their financial intelligence to create money in derivative market. Let’s first discuss about future derivative market.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Imagine if the company issue 200 shares . You buy a 100 lot of shares of this company from the Future derivative market. Let’s say the price of one share is 10 Rupees. So the total valuation of the company is 2000 Rupees. If you bought 100 shares in lot in Future derivative market you don’t need to pay for all the shares that you bought. For example, in this case you don’t need to pay 100 multiply 10 , 1000 Rupees to buy shares. You can buy at 10-15 % of initial margin. What that means is that you can pay only 15 % of 1000 Rupees. That equals to 150 Rupees. So you paid 150 Rupees and bought 100 shares of the company , whose one share price is equal to 10 rupees. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Now if in the future , this company share price increase to 12 rupees per share. That means the worth of the shares that you hold i.e. the 100 shares price which was previously valued at 1000 rupees , that worth is increased to 1200 Rupees.  12 multiply by 100 equal 1200 rupees. You can sell these shares and earn 200 rupees profit.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      However if the price of the shares , instead of going up , goes down in future , let’s say to 8 rupees then the net worth of your holding of shares would be 800 rupees and you have to pay those 200 rupees loss .  Such a market where transaction like these can happen is called Future derivative market.  That’s why some people like to call this market as double edge sword market. Because loss and gain in such a market is always in multiple. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      However if you see the share of your prices decrease to 8 rupees per share and believe that such a phenomena is temporary and thinks that in nearby future the price of the stock would rise again then to hold your investment in future derivate market you have to pay what is called maintenance margin.  The amount of money you lost when the share price went from 10 rupees to 8 rupees and you incurred a loss of 200 rupees, then to maintain your that investment you have to pay the same amount again , that is 200 rupees , to maintain your positions in future derivative market.  \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Now imagine that instead of stock rising in its price , it declines more, from 8 rupees to 6 rupees , and you still want to maintain your position in this investment then again you have to pay maintenance margin.  Till when will this go on and on? Until unless you become bankrupt or the expiry date of the deal comes to your rescue. You can very easily just book your loss when the share price reaches 8 rupees and get out of the deal. But many people still hold them for long, and I don’t know why. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Many expert traders say that you must book your loss as early as possible and book your profit as late as possible.  In future derivative markets, there is risk in multiples and profit in multiples , that’s why the name double edge sword. In such a market , profit and loss both happens in multiples.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Is there any way by which you can reduce your risk in such type of investment and increase your reward. According to many traders , there is , that market is called option derivative market.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Option derivative market has 2 segments , one is called Call option and another is called put option. Let’s first explore Call option. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      We talked about NIFTY before. The average of all the stock market prices is taken in NIFTY. NIFTY contains top 50 stocks , so these top 50 stock price average is taken and then a single number value is obtained from it. You might have heard in news reports reporters talking that NIFTY fall 50 points or NIFTY raise by 20 points from the earlier 11,000 points. This 11,000 points( taken as an example, this value changes) is the average of the top 50 stock prices. If the stock prices of those 50 stocks change , it directly have an impact on NIFTY point table , and NIFTY goes up by 20 points or goes down by 20 points.  \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      In call option , you can take minimum risk and maximize your profit, that’s what the traders says. In call option derivative market , you make a bet on Market. For example the NIFTY at present is at 11,000 point. You think that NIFTY would cross 12,000 points. You place a bet on the market that the NIFTY would cross 11,500 points.  This placement of bet in market is called strike. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Strike are of 3 types , first is called out the money strike. The NIFTY at present is at 11,000 points and you have made a bet at 11,500 points. This has not happened yet. Such type of strikes is called out the money strike. 2nd type of strike is at the money strike. You have placed a bet at 11,000 points this time , not the 11,500 points and you think that the NIFTY would remain at this price or go beyond it , such a strike is called at the money  strike as NIFTY is at 11,000 points , your bet point. 3rd type of strike is called in the money strike. You made a bet of 10,900 points. NIFTY is at 11,000 points. NIFTY has already cross your bet point , and you expect that it will remain at 11,000 Point or go above it, such a strike is called in the money strike. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Now imagine you place a strike call option out the money at 11,500. For that the buyer or the one who placed the bet has to pay the seller a premium. The seller will give back that amount of money to the buyer back , by which amount the buyer correctly predicted his bet. For example imagine you pay 100 rupees as premium to the seller and placed a bet as mentioned above. The NIFTY lets say crosses 12,000 points from 11,000 points . That means that your bet at 11,500 points is now in the money. You correctly predicted the bet by an amount of 12,000 – 11,500 = 500 points. How much money did we pay for this? 100 Rupees. So 500 – 100 = 400.  Our profit is 400 Rupees.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Now remember that we are in derivative market and we can only buy in lot. Let’s say there is lot of 75. So a profit of 400 multiply by 75 equal to a total profit of 30,000 Rupees.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      But what will happen if our bet goes wrong. What if NIFTY touches 10,500 from the 11,000 points and our bet was out the money at 11,500 points? In this case you don’t have to subtract the numbers. To calculate loss in such markets, You have to pay only what you paid initially, i.e. is 100 Rupees multiply by lot of 75 , that is equal to 7500 rupees of loss. So in this case , profit is calculated by how much amount of point your bet was correct. But loss is calculated by your initial premium  that you paid. So if you choose call buy option this is what happens.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Just as Buy call option is for betting the market going up , put option is when you think the NIFTY ( or any stock of a company  or other indices ) is going to go down. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Imagine that the NIFTY Is at 11,000 at the moment, and you think the NIFTY is going to come down. You bet using the option put and bet at let’s say 10,800. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      If you would have bet 11,000 , then it would be at the money. If you bet at 10,800 , something which has not happened then it is called out the money. If you would have bet at 11, 500 , then the market is already below 11,500 ,it will be called in the money.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Now you have bought a put, out the money at 10,800.  You pay premium of 100 rupees to seller. The market as you predicted goes down and reaches 10,500 points. Your bet is correct with the amount of 300 points. You bought the shares at 100 rupees. So your profit is 300 – 100= 200. You bought the shares at lot of 75. Total profit 200 multiply by 75 , that is equal to 15,000 Rupees. That is your total profit you earned.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      If the market does not come down and your bet goes wrong , you only have to pay 7500 rupees. Not more than that. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n    </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      Keep this in mind that this buying and selling of call and put, happens by people. So you cannot buy a bet that until unless someone is not selling it.\r\n      \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      Warren buffet says “financial derivatives are weapons of mass destruction” And he said it correct.\r\n      \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      Trading has no research other than that on prices of a particular stock. It’s pure gambling. It’s just a guessing game. Nobody can predict the market or time the market because such a market is running on emotions and impulse. You have no idea what will happen the next moment that will create an impulse or emotion of buy or sell in market.  \r\n      \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      People lose more money than they make in stock market trading. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      There are people called stockbrokers. Stockbrokers are people who trade for you. For every buy or sell transaction that you make, stockbroker earns a commission out of that.  So it does not concern them whether you make profit or loss, in both the cases they will take their commission. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Warren buffet says “Stock market is the only place that people ride to in a Rolls Royce to get advice from those who take the subway.” \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      You will find that stock brokers are more of a salesman , and less of traders. But still you give them money to trade for you in stock market.  You believe that they will trade for profit , but they themselves are earning money by their commission or charging fees from you. Whether you make profit or loss , they get their money. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      You might have often hear the rags to riches story , but believe me , they are very rare and pure luck. If you think your luck is as good as rags to riches guy , then go ahead and trade in whatever way you seem fit. But that would not be a wise thing to do , financially. Also those rage to riches story don’t end with happy ending, many lost money too afterwards, going bankrupt. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Stock market trading is the 2nd of the most unfair, riskiest and rigged market you will ever experience.  1st is Real estate ( not the riskiest but the most fraudulent one). There are lots of thing that goes behind the scene, by powerful people, so that they can rig the trading of stock market and drive prices according to them. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      For example, Insider trading. What traders do is they establish network with people in various company management position and they ask for information of that particular company before it gets leak or published in press.  They give a commission of their profit to these people in company management position. News have impact on people sentiment to sell or hold that company stock.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n      For example there is a news that a particular car company is introducing new model to market and is expected to sell that car like hot cakes. This news will drive the stock price of that company higher as everyone want to cash in on the growth of the company. It will create high demand for that stock. But before this news can be made public, some traders who has access to company inside, already get to know this news and they bought the company stock at let’s say when the price was 100 Rupees. Now when the news become public , the people sentiments are high to buy that stock increasing it demand, but the supply or stock of stock is limited. So its price increases. From 100 rupees it reaches 200 rupees per share. The insider traders earn huge profit in this and give a percentage of profit to the company insiders too.  Such a system created a monopoly of some few traders , those who were well connected.  Insider trading is not allowed by law. Its illegal to do that and punishable, but still some people do this. Its illegal or not is still a debatable topics in various countries , in some countries it is illegal and in some it is not.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Recently some US senators who were getting day to day briefing on COVID – 19 at the month of February were in the soup after being accused of insider trading. On 7 February, shortly after the first case of coronavirus was reported in US, one of the senator wrote on one of the news channel that the US government was “better prepared than ever” to tackle an outbreak.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n\r\n\r\n      But a week later, when President Donald Trump assured the public that the virus would not hit America hard, Senator and his wife sold between $628,000 and $1.72m in stocks, including shares in two hotel groups. It created a controversy in America and charges of insider trading were exchange in barb of words. People claimed that they knew the extent to which COVID will hit America and hid that information with public as they were getting briefed on day to day basis about the pandemic.\r\n\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Another is people create a fake and manipulative news about a certain company. Or they create a fake mood in the market that a particular stock is going to go up today , so you better buy it .  They make this news sort of viral. You might have heard about people giving or taking tips on what stocks to buy or to sell. These tips are created to manipulate stock market prices and create a demand for certain stocks or excess supply of stocks in stock market. For example I am holding a stock of 100 rupees and it is not giving me profit. I create a fake and manipulative news backed by nothing that this stock is going to go up today in price so buy . This increases the demand for my stock and increases it price from 100 rupees to 200 rupees per share. I sell share at 200 rupees per share and earn my profit, meanwhile those who get stuck with overpriced share suffer losses when the stock crashes after a while. These are people who bought the share based upon “tip” by his friends , family or someone he knows.  This showcase poor financial intelligence of that person. A financial intelligent person should always check or verify facts; he should listen to opinion but always act after verifying on his own. Never trust anybody else opinion , especially when you are dealing in stock market trading, always verify facts yourself. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      There is another scam that takes place. Go to net and search stock market trading services. You will see lots of services and stockbrokers or people claiming that they can get you 200 or 100 % or 50% or 30% return in a month based on them sending you tips and suggesting you which stocks to buy or sell. They offer you free 1 month subscription and then charge you for the subsequent month subscription. Here is how the scam works. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Imagine you have 500 people taking the 1 month free subscription offer of the company services. Now company send message to all 250 people out of those 500 to buy , lets say ABC company stock, as it will go up today. To the rest 250 people it sends message that to sell ABC company stock as its going to go down today.  The ABC stock in the market would either go up or go down in the stock market. 250 people think the information provided by the Company service is accurate. The other 250 give up on the company prospect of providing them with valuable tips. Next they again do this with 125 people , providing them either to buy or to sell. Again those 125 people who got it correct in stock market thinks that the company has been correct 2 times in a row. The rest 125 who didn’t get it correct gives up on company prospect and move on. Now again the company would send 62 people the option to either buy or sell and to 63 to buy or sell. Let’s assume the 63 person got it correct on stock market. These 63 persons would think that the company has provided correct and accurate information to them 3 times. Their offer is genuine. So they buy the company subscription for the next month and the subsequent months. The rest 62 person who got it wrong , give up on the company prospect .  It is only after few months that those 63 person who got it right in stock market on company tips and stock suggestion realizes that they have been duped.  Just ask them if they promise 200 % returns monthly then why don’t they earn it themselves rather than taking the subscription fees from you. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      That’s why financial intelligence and empowerment is so important . So that you can stop getting duped by people. People like stockbrokers who don’t care about your profit and loss. Not all stock brokers are bad , some are genuine and wants your benefit too. But you got to research before selecting your stockbroker. Ask them for a report card of how they have done in the past. Check for yourself how they have performed in market. Are they commission based or fees based? What are their terms of payment. If they only take a part when you make profit then sign them up, cause then  interest is mutual. In that case you both grows. But if the condition is like you pay them monthly fees or he just take a pie , either you make profit or loss , then guard yourself.  Generally people choose stock brokers because they don’t know how to invest and trust people like stock broker to do it for them.  People who don’t want to learn how to invest or don’t know how to invest choose stock broker. I recommend that it’s much better to develop your financial intelligence enough so as you are responsible for your own finance . Even if you lose money yourself in stock market , you will only blame yourself and you will learn from it. Don’t invest, before developing your financial intelligence and knowledge. Don’t invest before learning how to invest. You don’t drive a car before learning how to drive a car, why you invest before learning how to invest. Educate yourself, and be responsible for your own finance.  Don’t depend on stock broker. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Trading is also exhausting emotionally. There is so much emotions and impulses involve that it will draw upon you. You don’t want to live a life of rush and push.  There is no logic in doing trading in stock market.  And if you are not careful you will lose all your money in the blink of an eye.  Many people lives have been ruined by doing stock market trading, following tips blindly, getting caught in manipulative and fake news and have ended up ruining themselves. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      If you want to still participate in stock markets trading , then my advice is never invest in trading by taking loan. Many people take loans to either compensate for the losses they took on stock market or just to buy more stocks.  I have already told you before , being in debt is a sign of low financial intelligence. So if you are trading, make sure that it’s on your own money , and you can afford that money loss if things go haywire and you have to pay. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      You can create money in trading if you have read news or you are just optimistic about the economy. You think that it is going to go up , you can buy a call option for that. If you think that economy or stock of a company is going to go down or fall , then you can buy put option. But only buy that much which you can afford.  Or you can also just simply deal in cash market , by buying one company stock and selling if it goes up, called intraday trading. The choice is yours how you sharpen your financial intelligence and use that to create or earn money. A whole another book can be written on Stock market trading and many authors have written it too. In my book however , I would like to stop here only. However I would recommend only to invest in stock market trading if you are ready. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      There is another way people invest in stock market other than trading. It is called value investing. Let’s see how people use their financial intelligence and create money in value investing. \r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n      \r\n      Suggestion- Many would consider it financially wise to not do Stock market trading and stay away from it.  Financial intelligence is not only about what to do but also about what not to do.\r\n      </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  </Container>;\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
