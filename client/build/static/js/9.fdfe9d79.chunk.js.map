That’s why avoid the debt\r\n        trap. The banks wants that you remain in debt, so that they can create\r\n        money out of you. Be patient and don’t be an emotional fool, you may see\r\n        your friends riding costly car with bank debt, or going to heavenly\r\n        vacations by using bank debt or using up their savings, but by having a\r\n        high emotional intelligence and IQ , learn to handle your emotions and\r\n        not get swayed away by it. As I said before, emotional intelligence and\r\n        IQ plays a good amount of role in your financial intelligence and IQ. In\r\n        the world of social media , it easy to get swayed by your emotions when\r\n        you see your contacts posting about their new homes or cars , or posting\r\n        about their photos about them enjoying the forts of Rajasthan or the\r\n        beauty of the Shimla . But don’t get swayed by all that. With emotional\r\n        intelligence you can do achieve much more than they have or are\r\n        achieving now. It’s not a competition. If you are happy for them that\r\n        they are enjoying, and if you can celebrate along with them in their\r\n        happiness then that is good. But if you can’t and seeing yourself\r\n        struggle and them enjoying , and if that makes you jealous or when you\r\n        start comparing your life with theirs, then I suggest you close your\r\n        social media accounts and mind your own business. Your emotional\r\n        intelligence plays a big role in your finance.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        When you are on the journey to create asset for yourself , do keep in\r\n        mind that you generate enough of those so that you don’t have to work\r\n        again. Set a goal for yourself , that I must have this much amount of\r\n        asset , putting this much amount of money in my pocket every month\r\n        without me working to earn money. Many people termed this as Financial\r\n        Independence, where If you get fired from your job today, you still have\r\n        enough asset so as your life continues unaffectedly. When you will have\r\n        enough asset for yourself , you will not go to job to work for money ,\r\n        but you will go because you enjoy it i.e. if you still keep working\r\n        after you have attained financial independence. To work or not is your\r\n        choice , but that’s not something that will be forced upon you because\r\n        you have to survive. That’s the freedom Creators yearn for. The power to\r\n        choose and not get forced on something .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Investment avenues is a term made up of 2 words. Investment and avenues\r\n        . Investment is when you invest your money to gain ROI, which is short\r\n        for return on investment. Avenues means places. Investment avenues means\r\n        simply , the places to invest to gain ROI.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        When you gain ROI from your assets and invest them again into assets , a\r\n        chain of returns is formed which is termed as Compound interest , and\r\n        with time it grows exponentially. Compound interest is the addition of\r\n        interest to the principal sum, or in other words, interest on interest.\r\n        It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so\r\n        that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum\r\n        plus previously accumulated interest.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Simple returns is just ROI. The interest you earn on your investment one\r\n        time. But compound interest allows you to earn interest multiple times\r\n        on your one investment or many. You can use compound interest to create\r\n        a financial freedom base for yourself.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        In this section and subsequent chapters we will talk about various\r\n        investment avenues you can invest in and how by using your financial\r\n        intelligence and IQ in them you can create a financial freedom base for\r\n        yourself. We will see how people have used their financial intelligence\r\n        and IQ to create a financial freedom base for themselves. We will talk\r\n        about how we can use various avenues for our advantage and where people\r\n        commit mistakes in them so we can learn from them.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Here are Various Investment Avenues :-\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '30px'}}>\r\n        1.
