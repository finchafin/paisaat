Forex is short for Foreign exchange. Foreign\r\n        exchange market is a market which is made up of currencies. People buy\r\n        and sell currencies as their value keep fluctuating with respect to each\r\n        other. Forex market comes in derivate market, you can only buy and sell\r\n        in lots here. As US dollar is the world currency , people measure how\r\n        much the 1 US Dollar is in value in that country currency. For example 1\r\n        USD = 70 Rupees. Here is how the Forex market works.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Forex market is a open market , what that means is there is no statutory\r\n        body to regulate it. Although in India, RBI does interfere, but only\r\n        when RBI sees a disruption in this market that could affect the economy\r\n        of India ( For example in 2011 when foreign investors withdraw huge\r\n        amount of dollars from India making the economy volatile). Also RBI keep\r\n        regulating the market if and when they see fit so it can be said that\r\n        RBI does regulate the Forex market up to an extent to protect economic\r\n        interest of this country.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Dollar is connected to the oil. India imports lots of oil. And India\r\n        buys these oils via US Dollars. From where does this US dollars come to\r\n        India? Foreign Investors when they invest in India bring dollars with\r\n        them, or From India Exports comes US Dollar. If in a short amount of\r\n        time, Foreign investors pull their dollars back from the Indian market,\r\n        the import-export equilibrium hampers and the economy gets thrown in\r\n        turmoil. To protect itself against this sudden withdrawal of Dollars\r\n        from the market, the RBI holds Foreign reserve in its vault to protect\r\n        the economy of this country.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Again, the forex market works on the principle of demand & supply. Forex\r\n        market is open market, what that means is that the market itself is\r\n        allowed to decide the exchange value of Rupee w.r.t dollar. Forex market\r\n        works in floating exchange rate, means there is no fixed exchange rate\r\n        for currencies involved. What that means is that if today 1 USD= 60\r\n        Rupees, then it is 100% possible that 1 USD = 65 Rupees tomorrow. And\r\n        actually this happens a lot, you might have heard in news about\r\n        reporters saying that rupee fall by this amount against dollar and or\r\n        rise by this amount against dollar. What they are saying is the change\r\n        in those exchange rates.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        For example let’s say 1 US Dollar = 60 Rupees. Now I am a shopkeeper who\r\n        imports computer hardware like desktop from outside India and sell it in\r\n        Indian market. So I have to buy in dollars and sell in rupees. Imagine\r\n        due to certain market conditions, the dollar to rupee value slips to 65\r\n        Rupees. What that means is that the rupee has depreciated in value. As\r\n        an importer that is bad for me. Why? Because yesterday I have to pay 60\r\n        rupees to buy a desktop ( assuming desktop was costing the shopkeeper 1\r\n        USD) and sell it in 100. My profit was 40. But now I have to buy it in\r\n        65 Rupees, and when I sell it in 100 rupees in Indian market, my profit\r\n        is 35 Rupees. My profit margin decreases. So Rupee Depreciation is bad\r\n        for importers. But what market conditions would lead to depreciating of\r\n        Rupee?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        As I said before that in 2011, the FIIs (Foreign Institutional\r\n        investors), or simply the foreign investors pulled out lots of amount of\r\n        dollar from the Indian market. That increases the demand for dollar in\r\n        Forex market of India. As the supply of Dollar was limited and its\r\n        demand increased, the price of how much Rupee to pay to buy 1 dollar\r\n        increases. And hence Rupee Depreciated. Now India who imports oil in\r\n        large quantity has to pay more for its oil import.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        But as an exporter residing in India, Rupee depreciation is beneficial\r\n        to me. Let’s see how.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Imagine I export Mangoes from India to another country. Till now , 1 USD\r\n        = 60 Rupees. So I sell my produce at let’s say 1 USD in the foreign\r\n        market. Rupee Depreciates. Now 1 USD = 65 Rupees. But I am benefiting if\r\n        I keep my selling cost at 60 rupees only. My profit margin at 60 rupees\r\n        selling point is let’s say 30. And I sell 5 mangoes in the foreign\r\n        market for 60 Rupees at a profit of 30 each. What that means is that the\r\n        foreign market pays me 5 USD and I earn 300 Rupees on my produce and a\r\n        profit of 150 Rupees. Now as Rupee depreciate , and if I keep my selling\r\n        price fixed that is 1 mango for 60 Rupees , then the foreign market\r\n        would pay me 0.9 USD for my Mangoes , and I would still maintain my\r\n        profit margin. But how does this benefit me as an exporter? Well it\r\n        increases my competitive advantage as I am selling my produce at cheap\r\n        prices over all the other competitors in the world. And it is costing me\r\n        nothing. Also before, if the foreign market would give me an order of 5\r\n        mangoes, they will increase the order for 10 mangoes as they too are\r\n        being benefit by paying less dollar for the mango produce. So my profit\r\n        as an exporter increases in terms of volume exchange of goods or\r\n        services and via competitive advantage that cheap prices provides to me.\r\n        So Rupee Depreciation is good for me as an exporter.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        But again there is a catch here for exporters. Imagine I am making\r\n        utensils that I am exporting to foreign countries. Now my manufacturing\r\n        plant is set up in India, but I need raw materials to make utensils. Raw\r\n        materials like minerals and metals. Now if some of those minerals or\r\n        metals are not found in India, but is imported by India then this\r\n        depreciation of Rupee is like walking in a double edged sword. At one\r\n        look the import bill of company becomes costly, and at the other look\r\n        ,the export profits of the company increases not in quality but in\r\n        quantity of goods and services sold. So a company has to tread carefully\r\n        and create a healthy equilibrium. Excess of Rupee depreciation can force\r\n        the industries to close.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Japan has done their currency depreciation (back in the 80s) against US\r\n        dollar in order to make themselves competitive. Their automotive\r\n        industry export various cars and other transports to America and to make\r\n        them competitive against others in the world, they purposely deprecate\r\n        their currency. Companies like Sony, Panasonic which are Japanese\r\n        companies, just took massive market share in America by making their\r\n        exports cheap and quality and at the same time profitable. Americans\r\n        noticed this and in 1985 decided, along with other western economy to\r\n        devalue dollar. This devaluation of dollar appreciated the Yen (Japanese\r\n        currency). Now American local manufacturers or other manufactures of the\r\n        world could compete with Japan. This led to a economic disturbance in\r\n        Japan and since then there have been many boom and bust in the Japanese\r\n        economy because of this. In only this decade, the exchange rate has\r\n        become somewhat a little stable, and the Japanese companies have\r\n        realised the folly of doing business with such wicked tactics.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        It is my personal opinion that such economic gimmick would never result\r\n        in long term prosperity of any country. If any country has to grow the\r\n        best thing that they can do is to create opportunity for Entrepreneurs\r\n        to come out with solutions that people want or consumer wants. The best\r\n        thing that a country can do is to incentivise people to take risk and if\r\n        they fall then create an ecosystem where people can rise again to take\r\n        risk and succeed. That is what would work in the long term for any\r\n        country economic prosperity.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Rupee Depreciation can increase inflation in the country. Because\r\n        importers, to maintain their profit margin, can increase their selling\r\n        price in India leading to inflation. RBI during post-pandemic period ,\r\n        started to buy dollar and keep it in their vault as foreign exchange\r\n        reserve. What that did was the demand for dollar in market increases and\r\n        its supply became limited or scarce. That depreciated the rupee, as\r\n        people have to pay more in rupees to buy 1 USD. This benefited\r\n        exporters. That was the intended purpose of RBI for buying dollar from\r\n        the open market, as it wanted to incentivise the Indian exporters. At\r\n        the same time RBI was preparing itself if due to any reason , the FIIs\r\n        or Foreign investors, like in 2011 they did, pull out dollars from the\r\n        Indian market. If that happens then RBI would be better prepare to\r\n        handle the situation this time and protect the Indian economy from the\r\n        shock.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        What about Appreciation of Rupee? Well the whole thing plays out\r\n        opposite. If dollar supply is more and demand is less in the open market\r\n        then what happens is that it benefits importers and harm exporters.\r\n        Imagine if 1 USD = 60 rupees today and it is 50 Rupees tomorrow. Then\r\n        the exporters profit margin would cut to 20 rupees and the importer\r\n        profit margin would increase by 10 rupees more.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        This was the economic part of Forex market. The investment and trading\r\n        part is quite simple.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        As this exchange rate keep changing , people buy dollars or other\r\n        foreign currency and hope that their respective currencies depreciate\r\n        w.r.t to that. If I buy at 60 , 1 USD and Dollar becomes strong against\r\n        that currency and it has become 1 USD= 65 , then I can sell my 1 USD and\r\n        earn a profit. But remember you are in derivative market, and in\r\n        derivative market you can only buy in lots not in single units. So\r\n        profit or loss is always in multiples.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So coming back to the question, what would happen if the dollar crash in\r\n        the International market. Well that just simply means that demand for\r\n        dollar would fall heavily. And if it does, then dollar would weaken and\r\n        other currencies would appreciate in their value. Now why I said I Don’t\r\n        know what would happen is because the Dollar today is linked to oil.\r\n        Would the OPEC countries would stop selling their oil in Dollars? If it\r\n        does that then India would be benefited from it. But at the same time a\r\n        dollar crash would have an impact on our those services through which we\r\n        earn dollars. For example our IT industry. They serve America and earn\r\n        in direct dollars. The IT industry would see their revenue fall and\r\n        there would be job losses. At the same time , I Don’t know if the\r\n        countries would move towards a new currency which can be used as an\r\n        international currency of exchange or whether they would move towards\r\n        Cryptocurrency. The real answer is I don’t know or I don’t have the\r\n        expertise to tell you, I am not knowledgeable enough perhaps. But if\r\n        something like this happens then economic depression would surely\r\n        happen. But whatever happens, make sure you are well prepared for it.\r\n        Make sure that you develop your financial intelligence and IQ and you\r\n        remain sound enough to be able to tide over tough times financially.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
