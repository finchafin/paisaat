He is the guy who won 5 Crore Rupees\r\n        (6, 78, 608 US dollars) by winning on a popular knowledge based quiz TV\r\n        show where the host ask you questions ranging from various topics like\r\n        history , general knowledge , sports to arts to architecture and science\r\n        and food. You would think that now he has become rich, he would be\r\n        living a life of happiness. But rich is a temporary phenomenon. What\r\n        happened in his life after winning is interesting. You would expect\r\n        anyone to be happy after winning 5 Cr Rupees. But Shushil Kumar posted\r\n        on his Facebook account, stating that the time after he won 5 Cr was the\r\n        worst time of his life.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        A newspaper wrote about him stating :-\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        However, after failing to invest his prize money wisely, Kumar is now\r\n        struggling in his life.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Kumar started the post by sharing how the time after he won the quiz\r\n        show was the most challenging time for him. He said that he did not know\r\n        how to handle the new developments in his life. Kumar shared, “I became\r\n        a local celebrity and was invited for multiple events across Bihar (the\r\n        state name he resided in) for 10-15 days every month. Because of the\r\n        same, my education took a back seat. Also, I used to take the media very\r\n        seriously back then. And to avoid being taken as jobless whenever they\r\n        called me, I started investing in various businesses.”\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Shushil Kumar added that most of these ventures flopped and he lost a\r\n        lot of money. He also shared that after the quiz win, he got passionate\r\n        about charity and would donate close to Rs. 50,000 every month. However,\r\n        many misused his philanthropy and duped him off a lot of money. Kumar\r\n        revealed that his relationship with his wife also started straining, as\r\n        she felt he had lost the sense of right and wrong.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        He further states in his social media post “While I spoke to the\r\n        reporter, they asked me something that triggered me. And I told them (in\r\n        a sarcastic way) that I have lost all my winning amount and bought two\r\n        cows. Selling the cows’ milk is now my way of living and earning. The\r\n        news report spread like wildfire,” he shared. Adding that after that,\r\n        people stopped calling him for events, and others stayed away from him.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Shushil then end up preparing for teaching course earning a degree, and\r\n        got associated to doing works for environment NGOs, from winning 5 Cr to\r\n        losing all of that money Shushil Kumar story teaches us the importance\r\n        of financial empowerment and why it is so necessary.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Why am I sharing this example with you? Because this example portrays\r\n        the myth that people think a high income make them wealthy or lots of\r\n        amount of money makes them wealthy. It’s not an income that makes you\r\n        wealthy nor it’s a lot of amount of money that makes you wealthy. It’s\r\n        your financial wisdom and intelligence that makes you wealthy. Only you\r\n        can make yourself wealthy or poor. You may be earning high income, but\r\n        that does not elevate you from your poor financial condition.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        What is Financial Empowerment? It is not financial literacy only, nor it\r\n        is the Financial IQ and financial intelligence only. It is the ability\r\n        of person to take wise financial decision and make money work for him\r\n        rather then he/she working for money. It is the simple task of money\r\n        making money or creating money from nothing (legally acceptable ways of\r\n        course) even while you sleep. One of the Quotes of Warren Buffet is “If\r\n        you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until\r\n        you die.”\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial Intelligence is that part of our intelligence which we use to\r\n        create money. It is the intelligence of a person which is used for\r\n        creating financial independence base and how he/she handles his/her\r\n        Finance. How you handle Money, how you handle Finance, this is decided\r\n        by your Financial Intelligence.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial IQ is the measurement of Financial Intelligence. Out of total\r\n        Intelligence, how big or small is your financial intelligence, that is\r\n        measured by Financial IQ. How efficiently, smartly & effectively you\r\n        maintain your finance is dependent on your financial IQ. Emotional\r\n        Intelligence and IQ has a big role to play in both financial\r\n        intelligence and IQ. How much money you make , how much money you keep,\r\n        how you make that money work hard for you & how efficient you are in\r\n        maintaining your finance, is what determines your Financial intelligence\r\n        and IQ.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial Literacy is you learning about finance and basic terminology\r\n        associated with finance, like inflation, Diversification, etc and\r\n        understanding how external factors like an country economy can affect\r\n        your personal finance. This is the part where you learn about investment\r\n        avenues and how you can use those avenues to take advantage of them and\r\n        create a financial freedom base for yourself.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial Empowerment is a combination of all the above.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial Empowerment = Financial Literacy + Financial Intelligence +\r\n        Financial IQ.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial Empowerment is simply the ability of a person to take wise\r\n        financial decision and to be able to tackle murky financial times with\r\n        ease. A financially wise person create a base of financial freedom, he\r\n        does not look for job security, even though he might use job as a step\r\n        towards his freedom. He hates trading his time to earn few Rupees. He\r\n        yearns for freedom. A Financially wise man looks for opportunity where\r\n        he can create money rather than earn money, legally of course.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p variant=\"h3\">Why you need financial empowerment.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Shushil Kumar had to go through what he went because he did not use his\r\n        financial intelligence or develop enough of it. He answers every tough\r\n        question on the game show correctly. But when it comes to his knowledge\r\n        of finance, he failed terribly. Why was that he known everything but he\r\n        did not know how to handle money?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        He did not know how to handle money because no financial education is\r\n        given in schools. He was a financially illiterate person, who did not\r\n        sharpen and use his financial intelligence and IQ. As a result he\r\n        remained a financially disempowered person or to say this in another\r\n        way, he remained a poor person even after winning 5 Cr. Rupees.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        It is not the amount of money that makes you rich, it’s your financial\r\n        wisdom and intelligence that make you wealthy. So even if you earn a\r\n        high income, it’s not necessary that you are a financially empowered\r\n        person. So why you need Financial Empowerment?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Because you have not got all the time in the world. I ask several people\r\n        around me, and you can too ask yourself and people around you, who do\r\n        they work for? I get answers like I work for this ABC company, I work\r\n        for my patients because I am an doctor, I work for the government, I\r\n        work for this production company , I work at this restaurant , etc. To\r\n        me all these answers are wrong. People only work for one thing and that\r\n        is money. People trade their time, effort and energy to get money.\r\n        Trading your time effort and energy to get money is called earn money or\r\n        employee money. You get your pay check by an hour worth value of time\r\n        effort and energy you put. If you stop working you stop getting money.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        While there are other people who create money, even when they sleep.\r\n        These people have learned a secret, an understanding in life. They have\r\n        understood that if you don’t invest in your financial empowerment today,\r\n        you will keep working for the rest of your life and keep on sustaining\r\n        yourself on earning money or employee money. So they look for solution\r\n        and ways to make money work for them. They created a system where they\r\n        don’t have to trade their time, effort and energy as much as they do\r\n        while earning money to create money. To them earning money is equivalent\r\n        to slavery. They want to enjoy the freedom of their life, not slave away\r\n        their life.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Creator thinks earners are addicted to pay check. Creators of money are\r\n        willing to work without getting paid (because they don’t work for money,\r\n        money works for them). But earners would not even blink an eye if they\r\n        are not getting paid by an hour or second (because they work for money).\r\n        Creators learn to manage risk, earners tends to avoid risk. Creators\r\n        enjoy challenges and solving problems, earners tend to avoid problems,\r\n        they look for ways to make others responsible . That’s why there is\r\n        office politics. That’s why you would sometimes hear people complaining\r\n        about rich people. Sometimes their complaining has point & sometimes not\r\n        . They think that rich people are responsible for their poverty, which\r\n        is correct but up to a certain extent only. They themselves have huge\r\n        role to play in their poverty too. Creators think a lot on how to solve\r\n        problems and create value for everyone, earners think about creating\r\n        value for himself only. Creators give more then they receive, earners\r\n        don’t. Creators are visionaries , earners are not. Creators never stop\r\n        learning , earners stop.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So why do you need financial empowerment? Well I will tell you why I\r\n        need financial empowerment\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        I need financial empowerment because my time is limited , and I don’t\r\n        want to spend that precious time in working to earn money. My time is\r\n        limited , and I want to make the best of it , every single second. My\r\n        time is limited , and this limited time give me an opportunity to think\r\n        how can I value my time more effectively . My time is limited , how can\r\n        I use this time to the maximum , meaningful , and in most learning and\r\n        sharing way. My time is limited , what am I doing with it? Where am I\r\n        investing my time in? My time is the most important , priceless ,\r\n        limited part of life. Am I using my time to grow myself deep into life\r\n        understanding , to become harmonious with the tune of the Universe? Am I\r\n        using my time to discover myself , learning to be happy ? What\r\n        constitutes my time? Am I using my time in the betterment of myself and\r\n        growth of myself as well as those around me?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Or am I just passing time doing what my parents told me to do , or what\r\n        my other friends are doing. Or should I just accept the societal\r\n        structure that has evolved in modern times where majority of people go\r\n        from one place to another in hurry to achieve nothing in their life.\r\n        They seem to act busy doing nothing. They have successfully fooled\r\n        themselves with ideas that other people around them propagated. They\r\n        have no single individual idea of their own, no originality inside them.\r\n        Majority of people just mindlessly copy each other style so as to stay\r\n        relevant to society not knowing that this thing make the whole society\r\n        irrelevant and themselves too. I need financial empowerment simply to\r\n        make the best of my time and make the best of me. I need time to do\r\n        things that are purposeful and give meaning to my life, which make my\r\n        life more like life and less like slavery.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        In the early morning I visit park every day to work on my health, and\r\n        when I return from park at around 7 AM or 7:15 AM in the morning, I see\r\n        people in formal clothes walking towards a bus stand to go to work or\r\n        their company bus dropping them home after their night shift has ended.\r\n        I see people older than me , much older like 30 to 40 years gap , still\r\n        wearing formal clothes and getting ready to go to office. I am very\r\n        amazed that how these people had gone to their job day after day after\r\n        day. Even after 30-40 years, people are doing job to earn money. I can\r\n        never work 30-40 year and remain so consistent with earning money. I\r\n        don’t want to work 30-40 years earning money. To me, that is huge waste\r\n        of my time, energy, effort and most important of all of these things, my\r\n        potential. I want to live my life to highest of my potential and to the\r\n        highest of my capabilities. I want to challenge myself and want to make\r\n        myself compete with myself to become better. I want to learn, adapt and\r\n        realize. I want to BECOME what truly I am in deep inside and realize\r\n        myself. That’s why I want to be financially empowered.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Those are my reasons. You need to find your own reason. Generally,\r\n        benefits of financial empowerment are :-\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '40px'}}>\r\n        1. Your current full time job keeps you on financial red line. Meaning of\r\n        that is if you lose your job then you will not be able to sustain you or\r\n        your family financially for long. You work for money, but you have not\r\n        been educated on how to make money work for you , if you want to make\r\n        money work for you then you need financial empowerment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '40px'}}>\r\n        ​2. By being Financially empowered , you can create a secure Financial\r\n        base for you and your family. You can wade through tough times and you\r\n        do not have to depend on your job for your financial security . You have\r\n        protection against getting fired by your employer .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '40px'}}>\r\n        ​3. You can attain Freedom from Rat race of 9 to 5 job & become\r\n        financially free ( you don't have to work for money anymore ) and\r\n        increase your quality of life by having more time in your hand to do\r\n        things that really matters to you in life and is close to your heart.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '40px'}}>\r\n        ​4. You don't become a victim of Financial fraud .By getting Financially\r\n        empowered you will be able to take wise financial decision on your own &\r\n        your financial health will be the responsibility of you only .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '40px'}}>\r\n        ​5. By getting Financially empowered, you can become wealthy , not rich.\r\n        Rich is a one-time temporary phenomena. Wealthy is a Permanent\r\n        phenomenon. You Can become Poor after being rich, but you cannot become\r\n        poor after being wealthy.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph} style={{marginLeft: '40px'}}>\r\n        ​6. By being Financially empower you learn to create money , and not just\r\n        save money or earn money.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If any of the above points appeals to you then financial empowerment is\r\n        for you. You may have your own reason to achieve financial empowerment\r\n        other than the above listed points and that is perfectly fine.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If you think you don’t need financial empowerment because you have nice\r\n        stable job then I ask you what will you do if suddenly you were fired\r\n        from your job.
