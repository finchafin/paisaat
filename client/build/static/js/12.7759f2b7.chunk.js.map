You might have even invested in it back in it 2017 or something. But what is Bitcoin and how does it work, and is it the future of the mankind? \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>        \r\n        Bitcoin is ONE of the cryptocurrency. There are many cryptocurrency out there. So what are cryptocurrency? \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Crypto currency is a form of digital currency. How it is different from the digital money that you are now using when you pay your electricity bills online? Well that is called internet banking and no , that is not crypto currency. Confuse? Let’s start with simplicity. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Today when we have to pay something from our mobile phone, what we do is we use apps like PayPal , PayTM,  or just online internet banking transaction. So imagine I have to buy a potato from a farmer via internet. How would I go on to do it? \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        I would go to my internet, and then type the bank name and go to their official website. I have created an online bank account, I logged into that and then fill the details of the bank account so I can transfer my money to him. All this transaction takes place via an intermediary, the bank. When I successfully carried out my transaction, the bank on its account section decrease say 10 Rupees and add 10 rupees on the account section of farmer. And this transaction has taken place, its confirmation or receipt is send on my mobile phone via a message in a instant of time. The bank in between takes a cut on that transaction. You might be using debit card or credit card to pay the farmer, the bank takes a cut and charges you fee for carrying out that transaction. All the transaction happens or goes through the bank. Such a system is called centralised system. All your transaction data, Bank account details , and all other information is stored in a device called Server. Server is just like a computer, but it act as the information storage device and sharing it onto the other computers like ours. So when you are watching a online video on the mobile , it is actually these servers which had those video stored in them and this server is transmitting that data to your device (mobile in this case). That’s why your video buffer and you see that circle going in circle thing. The speed at which that data is transmitted by the server and receive by your computer is called internet speed in general terms.  \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        All your data is stored in these servers. If you create your account of Facebook, then your data that you give to Facebook, Is stored in the server of Facebook. It is then access by million other people like you who are registered on Facebook and have given their data to Facebook. Facebook makes these servers data accessible to multiple parties. So the Facebook is like the bank in my transaction example. Such a system is centralised system. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Now imagine I don’t like the centralised system, because the monopoly that it has over our data allows them to use that data without our consent and sell our data to 3rd party without our permission. Or they target us with our data , and analyse our data to show us advertisement and influence our decision making. Or you & I just don’t like the centralised system because every time I make a transaction, the banks take a part of it. Or I just don’t like centralisation because well I just don’t like it. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So is there a way to decentralise all of this? Is there a way where I can make payments without an intermediary like bank, who spy over my every transaction and takes a cut?\r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        After the 2008 economic crisis, People saw how the big banks were bailed out. They (People) were cheated out of the system. In 2008 economic crisis, people paid and are to this day still paying and might tomorrow be still paying , the cost of some big banks greed. What happened in 2008 economic crisis was that banks had created financial product which stopped working. Banks had bought insurance against those financial product , so when they fail, they would get the insurance money. It turns out that the insurance company never expected the financial product to fail and has given the insurance company owner huge bonuses (amounting to millions in Dollars) as if there is no tomorrow. You must understand that banks bought those product using yours and mine Savings or deposit money. Because they are allowed to do that by the US Law. While this was playing out , the banks to save their skin and make more profit out of those failed financial product that went bad, started to create more of that financial product.  Now you might get confused and asked, if a financial product has gone bad, why create more? Well so that the banks can buy insurance against it. So when more amount of financial product fails, the banks which has bought insurance goes rich. So banks purposely created this bad financial product ( Collateral debt obligations – the name of the financial product ) and start selling to the general public and investors. The banks knew that these products are faulty and bad and it will bring losses to the investors , still they sold it , and sold it in millions of Dollars. Perhaps even in billions of dollars.  You don’t need to own the financial product to be insured against it downfall. For example if I own a house , then I pay for its insurance, but in this scenario of financial product, I can buy its insurance even if I don’t own it.  So what happens is that when a financial product fails , the insurance company has to pay to multiple people and not only to those who hold such financial product. And when these financial product went bad, general public or investors paid for it, like the Virgin island pension fund and many other, who sued one of the bank who sold them the faulty financial product. And as previously said , the insurance companies never expected these financial products to go bad, why? Because this particular financial product was made up of real estate. But it did go bust, and when it goes bust & insurance company did not have the money to pay to banks, the whole system collapsed. And we had what is called the 2007-08 economic crisis.  How was the problem solved? The banks went to Federal reserve and then to the President of the USA and warned him that if he does not take steps then the whole financial system would collapse, people savings and deposit would be lost. So the president of USA agreed to give money to these banks to cover their losses. But where did this money came from? The US government issued new bonds that were to be fulfilled with time via the taxpayers, and then gave it to the federal reserve in exchange for money. Now where did the federal reserve got the money to buy bonds from the government? They printed or created it out of thin air. From nothing. And the wicked part of all this is , the bond that government sold to fed reserve they had to be paid back via the taxes the government took from you and me. What that means is that the big banks blows up the world, and it is the common public that pays for it , not the banks.  Such a wicked centralised and corrupted system. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So in aftermath of 2008 , a Japanese citizen saw these things and went on Nikola Tesla mode. He wanted to build a system where the central banks were not required at all in the society. He wanted to get rid of system where for the greed of the banks , common people like you and I pay. So he published a research paper in which he introduced a peer to peer system , which was completely decentralised. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        What does peer to peer, completely decentralised system means? It means in simple terms, that when I am doing transaction, my transaction is done without any intermediary. If we take the example of me buying a potato from farmer, then a peer to peer completely decentralised system means, that I can directly transfer my 10 Rupees to his account , without banks.  This was kind of a revolutionary idea, because it give the power back in the hands of people. But how was this to be achieved? Through technology. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Satoshi Nakamoto , the Japanese researcher, proposed a new form of digital currency called cryptocurrencies. Crypto are different from your everyday use of money in that , first they are decentralized and don’t need banks or any intermediary to use them.  It is Peer to peer without any involvement of 3rd party. So they can escape the manipulation of Fed reserve as we see before with printing of money, etc. No central entity controls these types of cryptocurrencies. Well then how they are made and who maintains them? Again the answer is technology and people. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Blockchain is a technology which makes cryptocurrencies possible. Blockchain is a technology where computers are used to create a chain of block in sequence which contains information in cyber space. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Blocks of blockchain are made up of hash. Hash are the specific number that is used to identify a block. It’s like the ID card that you and I have , but for blocks. And this ID card , instead of having my photo and name like it has even today, in blockchain that is replaced by a specific number. Now these specific set of numbers are connected to the hash of the previous block and it’s the current block numbers which act as a linking agent for the next block to add itself.  So in the case of hacking if someone changes the hash number of any particular block, then it automatically changes all the subsequent block associated with it , and that is why hacking such a system is very difficult. If you have to hack this technology, you have to guess all the blocks number at the same time. Such linking of blocks which contains information inside them leads to the formation of chain. Hence the technology name Blockchain. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Now remember that in the payment system, the information that is stored in these blocks is the transaction that happens between 2 or multiple people. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Now imagine I have to add my block which contain the transaction that I have made to the blockchain. What I have to do to add my block to the chain? \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        To do that you must understand that the blockchain data that is formed is not only present in cyberspace, but in every computer on the earth which uses this technology.  To validate a transaction, all the computers which are associated and connected with this technology must validate it. Blockchain is present in every computer of the world which uses this technology. When blockchain add a new block every 10 minutes, the blockchain in the computers update themselves.  When you do a transaction via using this technology, what it does it puts that transaction in a pool of unverified data. What that means is that if you need your transaction to complete, it should be on the blockchain for everyone to see and verify. Many computers around the world use their processing power to constantly update the block chain and add blocks every 10 minute. When a computer achieves this they get a reward , and that is Bitcoin. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The process of adding the next block in blockchain is quite cumbersome. Why ? Because it uses maths. The computer are used to guess the number of the last block added in block chain, and when a computer guesses it , your block is allowed to get attached to the block chain and your transaction is verified. So the computer uses the power of processing to guess hundreds, or thousands or millions of number so that it matches with the hash number and the block of data then can now be added to the blockchain to verify itself.\r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        This explanation of technology is simplified and is written so as to make your understanding as a starter easy. So one should not quote the author on this. There are many resources which explains in much greater detail and clarity and with more easy way what this technology is , and I encourage you to go through them. Some of them are listed at the end of the book.\r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Now there are some problems that arises out of this system. First is that this system of computer guessing (and there is no other way to solve this problem, remember the hash that we talked about and correlate that with here) takes a lot of time.  A block of chain is added every 10 minutes and it can be added only at every 10 minutes interval, not before 10 minutes and not after 10 minutes. And if you are lucky enough to add your block to the blockchain, and imagine that you have to verify the 2nd transaction, then you would not be able to do that in the next 10 minutes? Why? Because other people are also trying to get their block adds to the blockchain to verify their transaction. There is a competition going on. Now you might say that those people who have a supercomputer or high power hunky dunky computer will then makes the most number of transactions and would not let other people use the technology. Well no, the technology is designed in such a way that when your computer guess the number for the first time, then the 2nd time the difficulty level for your specific computer is increased so others get fair chance to add their block. This process is called mining. Because when you add a block, you get rewarded by bitcoin.  \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        This system has some problem. Like for guessing the number and all , the computer uses energy. So the energy cost involve in such technology is high. Imagine if I am buying a 10 Rupee potato and it cost me energy bill of 20 Rupees. Would I use such a system ? No I won’t its unsustainable. Plus there is not enough energy produced in this world , to create a system which make Cryptocurrency or blockchain decentralised technology for mass adoption of use. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Another problem is that , when I go to buy potato from farmer, or imagine I am buying Tea from a tea seller, if I am using this technology , then I have to wait for 10 minutes so that my transaction can verify . I mean how awkward and waste of time it would be to spent 10 minutes just in waiting for the transaction to be verified. My tea would get cold by the time my transaction happens. Again such thing makes the Cryptocurrency technology unsustainable and not good for adoption by the masses. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        But technology is evolving very fast. What I have explained to you above is Blockchain technology version 1.0. There are blockchain technology version 2.0 and 3.0. What that means is that people are coming out with solution to the problems that I have stated above in these versions. Like for example to make the process of transaction more efficient, people come out with the concept and technology of lighting network. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        All in all this space is still work in progress and people are discovering this technology and tinkering with it. It’s like the early phase of internet. Just as internet decentralise information, Cryptocurrency is decentralising money. Cryptocurrency is the internet of money.\r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Bitcoin is one of the many cryptocurrencies available today that are created for this purpose. But Today it is used a speculative investment asset rather than an medium of exchange.  But as the technology is changing who knows we might use Cryptocurrencies in our day to day life. Many are very upbeat about it. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Central banks also came to this technology, but they came quite late to the party. China Central bank has already commissioned a cryptocurrency to use in their country. Similarly other banks, as they see that their monopoly on money is getting out of their hands, has come to issue their own cryptocurrencies. \r\n        </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
