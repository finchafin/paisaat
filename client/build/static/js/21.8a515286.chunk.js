What is compound interest? Its interest on interest. For example if you invest in asset and that asset gave you a return of 8 % and then you again reinvest the principal amount plus the interest you gain back into the asset to earn an interest on the interest. So if at first you earn 8 rupees extra , in the next time, you will earn more than 8 rupees on your interest and it will keep on increasing until unless you are invested compounded. And hence a chain of interest on interest will form. Keep in mind that inflation also works in compound interest so whatever you earn by compound interest in Savings schemes, that will be eroded by inflation. What I mean to say is that if you invest 1000 rupees at 8 % interest rate annually for 10 years at compound interest, then at end of ten years you will have 2,158 rupees. But at the same time, if the inflation rate also stays at 8 % , then you actually have not earned any money. The compound interest on your earnings has just maintained your purchasing power in bank balance. If 10 years before you could buy 10 apples with 1000 rupees, after 10 years of inflation rate same as your earned interest rate, you can buy 10 apples with 2,158 rupees. Because inflations raise the prices of goods and services as we learned before. Also in FD, when you take out withdrawal after the tenure has ended, government will tax you and so you will lose more rather than gain from saving schemes. And it\u2019s not that inflation rate will stay same every year. What would happen if it rises? Then you will get poorer. What will happen if inflation rates declines and your earning interest is higher than inflation rate (which in India it currently is)?
