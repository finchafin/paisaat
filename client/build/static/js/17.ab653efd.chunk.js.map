FDs give better interest rate to\r\n        depositors on their money then depositors get by depositing their money\r\n        in saving accounts. In FDs, an investor invests a lump sum amount and\r\n        lock in specific time period which can vary from 10 days to 10 years.\r\n        Breaking the FDs before set date of maturity attracts penalty and extra\r\n        charges. During this lock-in period banks gives interest rate on the\r\n        amount.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        How much interest rate a Bank gives on FD depends on the repo rate set\r\n        by Reserve Bank of India (India Fed Reserve) . Repo rate is a term which\r\n        simply means the rate at which RBI gives money to banks as loans and at\r\n        that interest rate the bank had to pay back the loan. For example if the\r\n        repo rate is 5 % , that means RBI has given loans to bank at an interest\r\n        rate of 5 %. The banks while giving loans will charge more than 5 % from\r\n        its borrowers , and the difference between these charging interest rate\r\n        is what generates profit for a bank. Repo rate affect everything like\r\n        interest rate on your car loan, home loan etc. On the basis of repo\r\n        rate, Banks decided its FD interest rate. If the RBI decreases its repo\r\n        rate ( because they want to stimulate demand in marketplace ) the banks\r\n        decreases its FD interest rate too. If the RBI increases its repo rate,\r\n        then banks increases its FDs interest rate in tandem.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Various banks offer different rates for FD . When choosing an FD compare\r\n        between different bank and decide which banks is offering high FD\r\n        interest rate.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        FDs are safe , but they in no comparison at all , provide returns as\r\n        much as you can generate by using other investment avenue. FD is more\r\n        like a saving scheme, but just with a higher interest rate.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
