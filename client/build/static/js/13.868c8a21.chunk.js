It\u2019s like dividing a rock into pebbles and dividing pebbles into small marbles. So people recommend buy more rocks. But rocks are already diversified into same limited set of pebbles and marbles, why diversify more and make it more complex and useless. It\u2019s a different scenario if the mutual fund is invested in money market instrument and other securities, then it can have some benefit , but again , you have to research about the fund before you see any tangible benefit.

For example if as an investor you invest all your money into one industry let\u2019s say Automotive. Now lockdown happens and the sales of the automotive sector crashes. The price of the stock comes down and you lose all your money. Imagine if you would not have invested all of the amount in automotive and invested in pharmaceuticals stocks along with automotive, then the scenario would have been different. As during pandemic , the demand for medicines shot up, and hence the stocks of pharmaceutical company shot up as more production was happening in factories and more sales were happening. So even though you may have accrued losses in automotive industry, the pharmaceutical industry would provide you some relief from your losses. Diversification does not mean that you invest in different company. It means you invest in different sectors and industry so as to protect yourself from any downfall. Diversification does not mean investing in the stocks of TATA motors and Mahindra (both belong to same sector and same industry) , it means investing in TATA motors and Sun phrama pharmaceutical stocks.

When you diversify in your investment portfolio it means that you don\u2019t only invest in direct stock market, but you invest also in bond market, mutual funds market, commodity market, real estate, PF and FDs so as to distribute risk among various investment avenue and protect yourself from risk. You can divide your investment principal into various investment avenue and diversify. Then you can check how much an investment avenue is performing and you can decide accordingly. Also you can use diversification strategy to maintain liquidity in your investment portfolio. You can use various debt based securities or invest in REIT & INvIT to have liquidity.

There is just not enough time, energy and effort that one can use to keep track of those diversified stock investment done in a wrong way. Diversification in wrong way means that you buy multiple stocks of a similar industry and sector but of different companies. This is not diversification , although many claim it is. It is futile as it provides no risk mitigation or too little risk mitigation at the cost of risk diversification. Wrong way of diversification also means buying too many stocks which proves to be difficult to be tracked and maintained by you. So always buy a limited number of stocks.
