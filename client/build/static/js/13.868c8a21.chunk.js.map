You divide your investments into various different avenues so as\r\n        risk mitigation can take place.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Diversification is a smart strategy used by investors to protect\r\n        themselves from risk. For example if you are investing in stock market\r\n        only and not on any other investment avenue, then no diversification has\r\n        taken place. If tomorrow the stock market crash , you will lose all your\r\n        money in it. If you had diversified a sum of amount to other investment\r\n        avenue , like commodities or real estate, you could have protected your\r\n        wealth better.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Many people recommend on taking a diverse forms of mutual funds. Which\r\n        is not a good strategy as mutual funds in itself is already a\r\n        diversified fund in context to stock market. Buying more diversified\r\n        mutual funds would just means that you are buying the same thing (stocks\r\n        and bonds which are limited) through different sources. It’s like\r\n        dividing a rock into pebbles and dividing pebbles into small marbles. So\r\n        people recommend buy more rocks. But rocks are already diversified into\r\n        same limited set of pebbles and marbles, why diversify more and make it\r\n        more complex and useless. It’s a different scenario if the mutual fund\r\n        is invested in money market instrument and other securities, then it can\r\n        have some benefit , but again , you have to research about the fund\r\n        before you see any tangible benefit. Because you should not tie your\r\n        money in buying different mutual funds as that money can be used in\r\n        other investment avenue to grow your wealth.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Diversification happens in different level. First it happen in\r\n        investment portfolio . 2nd It happens in stock market.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Stock market diversification means when you are investing in not only\r\n        one company stock from one sector and industry but in different industry\r\n        sector company stock , so as if one sector industry fell & shocks, the\r\n        other can ride over the loss that an investor make in that loss making\r\n        sector. For example if as an investor you invest all your money into one\r\n        industry let’s say Automotive. Now lockdown happens and the sales of the\r\n        automotive sector crashes. The price of the stock comes down and you\r\n        lose all your money. Imagine if you would not have invested all of the\r\n        amount in automotive and invested in pharmaceuticals stocks along with\r\n        automotive, then the scenario would have been different. As during\r\n        pandemic , the demand for medicines shot up, and hence the stocks of\r\n        pharmaceutical company shot up as more production was happening in\r\n        factories and more sales were happening. So even though you may have\r\n        accrued losses in automotive industry, the pharmaceutical industry would\r\n        provide you some relief from your losses. Diversification does not mean\r\n        that you invest in different company. It means you invest in different\r\n        sectors and industry so as to protect yourself from any downfall.\r\n        Diversification does not mean investing in the stocks of TATA motors and\r\n        Mahindra (both belong to same sector and same industry) , it means\r\n        investing in TATA motors and Sun phrama pharmaceutical stocks. So such a\r\n        diversification happens in Stock market is the right way of\r\n        diversification.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Diversification in investment portfolio is important from an investor\r\n        point of view. When you diversify in your investment portfolio it means\r\n        that you don’t only invest in direct stock market, but you invest also\r\n        in bond market, mutual funds market, commodity market, real estate, PF\r\n        and FDs so as to distribute risk among various investment avenue and\r\n        protect yourself from risk. You can divide your investment principal\r\n        into various investment avenue and diversify. Then you can check how\r\n        much an investment avenue is performing and you can decide accordingly.\r\n        Also you can use diversification strategy to maintain liquidity in your\r\n        investment portfolio. You can use various debt based securities or\r\n        invest in REIT & INvIT to have liquidity. So that when you find yourself\r\n        an investing opportunity but you lack liquidity, this diversification at\r\n        that time would come handy to you.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So diversification in personal investment portfolio means investing in\r\n        different investment avenues.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Warren Buffet says :- Diversification is a protection against ignorance,\r\n        It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.”\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Buffet was talking about the mutual funds diversification & wrong way of\r\n        doing diversification . It’s always wise to diversify your investments\r\n        but only when you diversify the right way. If you diversify the wrong\r\n        way, it will not work.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Many other investors say that diversifying poses the problem of not\r\n        being able to keep watch on stocks (note I am using the word stock only\r\n        ) if they diversify too much. There is just not enough time, energy and\r\n        effort that one can use to keep track of those diversified stock\r\n        investment done in a wrong way. Diversification in wrong way means that\r\n        you buy multiple stocks of a similar industry and sector but of\r\n        different companies. This is not diversification , although many claim\r\n        it is. It is futile as it provides no risk mitigation or too little risk\r\n        mitigation at the cost of risk diversification. Wrong way of\r\n        diversification also means buying too many stocks which proves to be\r\n        difficult to be tracked and maintained by you. So always buy a limited\r\n        number of stocks. Investors say don’t be invested in more than 20 stocks\r\n        at a time (that number is also for those who have gained a little\r\n        experience in stock market) , because that would prove too tough to have\r\n        an eye over.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So to conclude this part , If you are diversifying , then diversify the\r\n        right way. Diversification in stock market should be done the right way\r\n        and invest in limited amount of stocks so you can keep track of the\r\n        stocks that you are invested in and it does not overwhelm you. When\r\n        diversifying in investment portfolio , diversification again does not\r\n        mean to buy lots of different mutual funds as it serves no purpose and\r\n        is wrong way of diversification. Invest in different investment avenues.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Many investors say , that it is better to master the skill of using\r\n        their financial intelligence to master in any single investment avenue ,\r\n        and then stay in those avenue to create big profit for themselves. You\r\n        can also do that. Many known names have become master in developing\r\n        their financial intelligence in a specific investment avenue and have\r\n        gone on to become an expert in their field for example Warren Buffet in\r\n        Stock market. If you want , then you can follow the same strategy and\r\n        practices in one of the single investment avenue and become a master in\r\n        it and create money for yourself. Then you won’t need diversification if\r\n        you become top guy in your specialized investment avenue. That’s why\r\n        Buffet today can claim that he does not need diversification cause he is\r\n        an expert and great at the investment avenue he is playing in. But as a\r\n        average investor , and someone who is new to the world of investing,\r\n        until unless you don’t become expert in any one investment avenue, I\r\n        suggest you to diversify your investment the right way. You can throw\r\n        diversification out the window, once you have expertise in your mind.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        You must understand that every Investor has its own style of investing.\r\n        Buffet has a style of investing which works best for him. Similarly\r\n        there are other investors who has different style than buffet and that\r\n        works for them. You got to find your own inner style of investing that\r\n        works the best for you. Do not just blindly copy anyone. Be an original\r\n        thinker. Find a way to make money work for you as best as it suits you.\r\n        Do not follow anyone, and I repeat, anyone, without you using your\r\n        Financial intelligence first. You may have your own unique style of\r\n        investing that works for you that no successful investor follow, and\r\n        that is absolutely okay. In the end, don’t get so caught up that you end\r\n        up working for money. You don’t have to become the richest man on this\r\n        earth. You just have to Create or earn only that much amount of money\r\n        which is enough for you. Don’t try to become a big league player. Earn\r\n        that much, that you need. Be content with what you have. Peace is much\r\n        better then running your entire life in chaos for earning money. Do not\r\n        be afraid to be you.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Maybe your investment style would be to invest in mutual funds, or\r\n        invest in saving scheme. Maybe those investment works the best for you.\r\n        Or it can happen that you invest in real estate and investing in real\r\n        estate works the best for you , or be it stock market value investing or\r\n        trading. Whatever works for you the best, only you can decide that ,\r\n        nobody else. So find your own investing style and what strategy of\r\n        investment works the best for you and then stick to that and keep\r\n        improving upon it with wise use of your financial intelligence. This is\r\n        the very essence of financial empowerment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
