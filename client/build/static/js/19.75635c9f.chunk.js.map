And Life insurance is\r\n        the insurance that your family would get in the event of your\r\n        unfortunate demise.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Enter into any private bank and they will start selling you schemes in\r\n        the name of insurance.

Please use your intelligence before coming\r\n        to any conclusion.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Health insurance is important because you cannot strain your assets for\r\n        a sudden demand of money. As if you put too much strain on your asset\r\n        they might break and your financial portfolio might break. So it is very\r\n        helpful if you invest in health insurance. As it will provide a cover\r\n        shock for you and your family against a sudden demand of money. Keeping\r\n        a active and healthy lifestyle will also lower the risk of having this\r\n        sudden demand of money. Stop buying advertised food products as they are\r\n        the major reason for illness and falling health. But even after all\r\n        this, it is good if you and your family are insured against illness or\r\n        any major decision that can put strain on your asset and might break\r\n        your assets. Many say , that we will earn money when we live, if we\r\n        don’t live then how will we earn money. Money can be earned back , your\r\n        health and life cannot.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        And that’s why once your life is gone, its futile to invest in a life or\r\n        as I call it Death insurance. That’s because once you are dead , no\r\n        sudden demand of money comes up because your already deployed assets are\r\n        taking care of your family financial needs. Assets are making money for\r\n        your family even after you die. Just make sure that you handle all the\r\n        legalities in smart way so as your asset are deployed for people you\r\n        want them to be deployed for. As many a times , a family gets in lawsuit\r\n        and try to claim your asset as their, often your relatives will do such\r\n        thing. So if you want to make your asset work for your parents , wife &\r\n        children or a good friend of yours, then make a legal will and execute\r\n        it. Not having a legal will , will throw your family in courtroom\r\n        battle.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Make enough asset that even when you are dead , they keep working for\r\n        your family. When you would have reached such a level, even if you die ,\r\n        you will die peacefully knowing that your family is taken care of by\r\n        your assets and they don’t need to depend on anybody for financial\r\n        matters. Not even you. That’s what the financial freedom is all about.\r\n        It’s about independence, it’s about being reliable. It’s about being\r\n        competent in your life in financial matters.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        What insurance company do is similar. They take your money or monthly\r\n        instalment and invest in asset and various other investment avenue. As\r\n        they know that not all of their customers are going to die in a single\r\n        day , they take your money , invest in asset in various investment\r\n        avenue and earn profit for themselves. They create profit out of a sense\r\n        of security of you. Insurance industry thrives on fear. So instead of\r\n        giving money to the agents of death insurance, you yourself do what they\r\n        are doing. Cut the middleman. Why you need them to invest in asset for\r\n        you? If you work on your own financial intelligence and empowerment you\r\n        can build assets for yourself, why give money to someone else for it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Making your asset work for family after you die is good but remember the\r\n        greatest asset is a person in itself. So while you are alive , teach\r\n        financial empowerment to your nearest ones or to the ones who are\r\n        relying upon you and dependent on you. For example your children.\r\n        Financial empowerment is not taught in schools. They don’t tell in\r\n        schools to invest in asset not in liabilities. So create strong\r\n        financial empowered base for your children so they grow up to be\r\n        financially wise. And in the process keep learning too as leanings never\r\n        stop.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
