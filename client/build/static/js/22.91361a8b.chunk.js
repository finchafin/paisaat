So I suggest that you can rent house at this age and with the money you save by renting, you can invest that to build your assets."}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{className:n.a.paragraph,children:"At this age , what you can do is rent 3bhk flats or plots. What you have to do is look for such properties to rent for yourself. Look for cheap rents and quality housing. And when you are finalising the deal with the owner of that house , include a clause or negotiate with the owner of the house that you can rent these rooms to others. Now you have 3BHK property as a rent. Lets assume that the rent of the 3BHK per month is 20,000 Rupees. What you do is you take one Bedroom for yourself, and rent the other 2 bedrooms to people for rent , where you will take the rent from them. You can set the rent prices of those 2 bedrooms. What will this do is it will cut your rent cost, making more money available for you to build asset or use that money to build your business. For example, lets say you decide to rent those 2 bedrooms at say 6,666 Rupees each. In total you are getting 13,332 Rupees via those 2 rooms. The rest of the rent you can pay with your own pocket which comes to out to be around 6,666 Rupees. Now if you would have taken a 2 BHK flat it will have cost you perhaps 15,000 Rupees (around this rate). Also remember that if you are in tier 1 cities , then the renting cost is high and you have to pay more. With this way you can save money, and with this save money you can invest in you asset building or invest that amount in your company. This age is the age where you can adapt to changing times as you build a career for yourself, so its much better to be versatile and dynamic with yourself. You can embrace the change quickly and adapt according to it."}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{className:n.a.paragraph,children:"Now if you are at say 30 years of age, and you want to settle down in life because now with time you are looking beyond your career and career is now not your priority, then you can settle for house to buy via bank loans. When you take loans from banks , you have to pay EMI. EMI are more in amounts/month than rent. But it provides stability if you are done with job transfers and changing jobs or from the volatility of market or your business. Now you have decided to settle in a particular city for a long time. But at the same time always keep in mind, that no matter what happens in the future, you have to pay your EMI. What do I mean by that statement? What I mean is that, if due to unfortunate circumstances you lose your job and can not find another job and become unemployed or your business went bankrupt then also you have to keep paying EMI. At such a scenario , if you are unable to pay EMI because you are jobless or without a business , then the bank will take possession of your house. You will be homeless. So always keep this thing in the back of your mind."}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{className:n.a.paragraph,children:"Bank charges interest on loan per year , not per amount. What I mean is by that is that the loan that you pay to the bank, in it a percentage of amount does not go towards repayment of your principal but payment of your interest on the principal. What that means is that you might be paying the banks for 2 years, monthly EMI, but your repayment of principal would be fraction of that amount. You had been paying interest majorly. Now to decrease this interest on the principal amount, use the concept of Pre-payment of loan excessively. Pre-payment of loan means that if your EMI for a month is say 35,000 , then you pay the bank 40,000 or 45,000 instead. What this would do is decreases your principal quickly and the interest on that quickly. This will help you in get rid of any excess of money that you end up paying in the interest on your loan. This will also help you to get rid of loan as quickly as possible. If you were wise, and you save money in your 20s , and build your assets then that assets too can pay for your loans. Its all about how you use your time and money to build a financial freedom base for yourself. And to do that effectively, you need to develop your financial intelligence, IQ and literacy. You need to be financially empower.
