Financial intelligence is simply the\r\n        ability to solve financial problems. You need money, you work hard for\r\n        it by earning it . Creators find solution to the problem of “they”\r\n        working hard for money. They do so by finding solution and creating\r\n        value for everyone. Creators create enterprises, they are entrepreneurs,\r\n        while earners are employee. Creators find solutions and create a\r\n        business out of it . These business exchange value for money, not\r\n        creators time effort and energy. While an earner has been told to follow\r\n        a certain set of norm of earning money through a safe stable secure job,\r\n        creators are flexible with change. They find opportunities and initiate\r\n        things, no doubt they fail a lot, but these failure accelerate their\r\n        maturity. Creators challenge themselves, earners don’t do that. Earner\r\n        waits for others to give them challenges.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        But even if you are an earner , don’t worry . There is still a solution\r\n        for earner to create a base of financial independence for themselves .\r\n        We will talk about that later.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        By using their financial intelligence , creators find solutions to\r\n        problems and create value to be exchange in society for money. They have\r\n        developed a system where they broke the set norms of society of earners.\r\n        They are creators in a society of earners. Let us understand by example\r\n        .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        I still remember when I was a child, and I had to go to my native place\r\n        village deep in another state. I used to travel with my mother , my\r\n        father also but sometimes. He used to be busy with his work. We had to\r\n        take a train to reach that another place. My father, at the time when we\r\n        used to step out of house to reach railway station, used to go on a bike\r\n        and hail an Auto-rickshaw from a nearby stand and made the auto follow\r\n        him back to the home. After then we would snuck our heavy luggage to the\r\n        inside of the rickshaw and would start our journey. After the invent of\r\n        apps based taxi-rickshaw hailing services , this all changed. Creators\r\n        created an application by which my father effort to go on a 2 wheeler to\r\n        hail a 3 wheeler was finished. Now with this application it created the\r\n        value for my father, he can save his effort and time and fuel too, and\r\n        directly hail rickshaw from his mobile phone to his home. Not only that\r\n        , but often rickshaw drivers used to refuse on going to the railway\r\n        station so my father had to negotiate with more than one rickshaw driver\r\n        which took more of his time effort and energy. Application based\r\n        services solve that too. If the rickshaw is not coming or the driver\r\n        does not want to go to station then one can simply cancel their booking\r\n        under 5 minutes and not be charged for that cancellation.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Creators act on creating value for everybody. They saw a problem which\r\n        was expenditure of time fuel and effort to find a rickshaw or taxi. So\r\n        they found a solution in application based services and created an\r\n        enterprise out of it . Earners would not be able to develop such an\r\n        mindset of problem solving, and even if they do , they will rarely act\r\n        on it because they are emotionally paralyze and have been trained to not\r\n        take risk and avoid problems in life. Taking on a problem means taking\r\n        on challenges. Creator chose the challenge themselves to create the\r\n        value of app driven services and make it useful for people to use and\r\n        exchange that value for money. There was no one who was pushing creators\r\n        to create the application, but creator created it and created a business\r\n        out of it. This is financial intelligence in action.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial intelligence has a lot to do with emotional intelligence and\r\n        IQ. Emotional intelligence is that part of intelligence by which humans\r\n        have either control on their emotions or they don’t become emotional\r\n        fools. The ability of humans to not get swayed by emotions and remain in\r\n        control is what determines emotional intelligence .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Earners emotional intelligence is hacked by other people for their\r\n        growth. From school they have been taught not to do any mistake, they\r\n        have been taught to compete, not to collaborate. Fear has driven them\r\n        for their whole life. Their motivation for doing something is not they\r\n        want to do something, but fear- “ If you don’t do this , then bad things\r\n        will happen in future. You will regret in future so you better do it”.\r\n        Statement like these have been used by teachers , and others to instill\r\n        fear of failure and to control you. It has a lot to with how the\r\n        schooling education system came into being. You are not taught the\r\n        values of courage in school, no character development takes place and no\r\n        financial education is there in school although we deal with finance in\r\n        our day to day life. The schooling education system of idea was inspired\r\n        by the Prussian system whose idea was to create a system of establish\r\n        labor to work for factory and corporations. Such a system does not allow\r\n        any questioning , and discouraged breaking of rules. Just do what you\r\n        are told, or else you will face bad consequences was the system motto.\r\n        Such a system was created by some very rich and powerful elite people to\r\n        keep people make themselves surviving constantly, not thrive among\r\n        themselves. They wanted an army of workers , where each worker work\r\n        fight for its own survival and not on the survival or thriving of each\r\n        other and of their own. Forget thriving , people find it difficult to\r\n        survive , so they have developed an system of “look for myself only”.\r\n        The 1% of super-rich elite know that this makes us weak, being alone and\r\n        isolated and where people compete and not collaborate. That’s why the\r\n        financial education is not taught in school education system. Because\r\n        they want you to remain workers. But nobody has stopped you to learn and\r\n        unlearn. You can always choose to be a creator if you are an earner.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Creators drive from within, not from an external source like fear or\r\n        greed. Creators create money , keep it with themselves and make that\r\n        money work hard for them.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Let us take another example to understand how financial intelligence\r\n        works.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        There are 2 people named Rohan & Raji (fake name, not associated with\r\n        any real person). Rohan work for money as an earner in a bag\r\n        manufacturing company and is a marketing manager in that company\r\n        position. Raji is an designer and work at an fashion designing firm,\r\n        designing clothes for models. Rohan gets a salary of Rs. 50,000 as an\r\n        marketing manager while Raji gets a salary of Rs. 70,000 per month.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Raji is a staunch bill payer. She believes that paying her bills is the\r\n        first thing that she should do with the salary she gets so as to sustain\r\n        herself . She thinks that she owes money and by not paying its bill she\r\n        will be prosecuted or she will be shamed by her society members. So she\r\n        pays the bills the first thing after getting her salary. Then she spends\r\n        her rest of the money on buying beauty products and going to spa for her\r\n        beauty treatment. She also goes to cinema to watch new movies. She spent\r\n        money on buying new clothes and buying decorative things for her house,\r\n        like a cool lamp, or new light bulb or buy a new cabinet for her clothes\r\n        to keep. Recently she bought an expensive car and she is very happy\r\n        about it . She says it elevates her social status when she shows her car\r\n        in the society and at workplace. She was an Top A student in her school\r\n        , proudly showing anyone who ask about her result card.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Rohan pay his bills the last thing when his salary is given to him. He\r\n        believes that one should pay himself first rather than paying others\r\n        first. What that means is that societal status is valuable to him too,\r\n        but not as much as her friend Raji. Rohan believes that when the salary\r\n        comes , rather than paying others via paying bills, he must first invest\r\n        that money in himself. Rohan spends money wisely on buying assets. He\r\n        does not spend his money on buying sports equipment. He does not spend\r\n        his money on his house decoration, in fact if you see his house , you\r\n        will see old creaking furniture. He has not bought a car yet, he says\r\n        it’s too costly to maintain it as you have to pay fuel on it and pay\r\n        money for maintenance of car. Instead of buying these things, he buys\r\n        asset. Assets are simply that thing which put money in your pocket even\r\n        when you sleep and liabilities are those which take money out of your\r\n        pocket even while you are working. If you check the balance sheet of\r\n        Rohan, its impressive to note that he has maintained various investment\r\n        avenues like stocks, bonds , mutual funds and is eyeing an investment in\r\n        real estate in the next month. All of these assets earn him money or\r\n        create money for him even without him being physically present. The\r\n        money that he earns or create from these assets he reinvests it back to\r\n        the asset to kick start an compounding rate cycle. Its money creating\r\n        money. After that he pays all his bills and other things. Rohan was not\r\n        a top rated student in his school , but his father was an financially\r\n        educated man, and so he taught his son the skill of financial\r\n        empowerment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Who do you think has higher financial Intelligence ? Rohan or Raji? You\r\n        are correct in guessing that Rohan has higher financial intelligence .\r\n        Let us see why.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Raji spends her money on things that does not make her money. Like\r\n        decorative lamps , or new furniture . On top of it , she has bought a\r\n        car, and now she has to spend her money on the car maintenance , taking\r\n        more money out of her pocket. With time, these furniture and\r\n        expenditures which does not make you any money deteriorate or deprecate\r\n        in value. The thing which she bought for 100 now values at 50. Raji made\r\n        herself poorer by buying these things of no financial value. Raji looks\r\n        rich , but if anybody reads her financial statement, she is living in\r\n        financial red line. Financial red line is a term which means that if you\r\n        stop working , you will stop having money. Even though Raji earns more,\r\n        looks rich, she is still financially illiterate & poor. She may be the\r\n        top student in her class when she was in school, but when it comes to\r\n        finance she has low financial intelligence.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Rohan , on the other hand , portrays high financial intelligence . His\r\n        father taught him about financial empowerment . He understands that\r\n        buying furniture or spending on things which does not make you money\r\n        with time and instead loses its value in time is poor financial\r\n        intelligence . Instead he used his financial intelligence to create\r\n        money. He is an earner working for money, but out of that he has\r\n        mastered the skill of making the money work for him. He invest an fixed\r\n        portion of his salary , into asset or various investment avenues. The\r\n        returns that he gets from them, he reinvests those into asset. He has\r\n        successfully deployed the money creating more money concept. He knows\r\n        with time , this money create money will grow into compounded growth\r\n        giving him higher returns and reducing his dependence on job , and\r\n        coming out of financial red line.. He says investing is not risky, being\r\n        financially uneducated is. He believes that financial illiteracy is\r\n        risky , not investment. He loves taking on new challenge and is not\r\n        motivated by fear or greed. He anticipates that with time, his salary\r\n        will increase to 80,000 from 50,000. But he wants to quit soon and start\r\n        his own venture. He was not good in his schools , he was an average ,\r\n        but still he has high financial intelligence . He pays his bills the\r\n        last thing in the month.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        I am not telling you to not buy cars or house decorative items. You can\r\n        buy all those but only if your assets pay for those, not your income. So\r\n        first build asset that covers the cost of your liabilities, then buy all\r\n        these things if you like. Simply put your assets must be greater than\r\n        your liabilities.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The difference between a low financial intelligence person and high\r\n        financial intelligence person is financial education & literacy. But in\r\n        all this where does the Financial IQ come?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Financial Intelligence is to look for ways to create money. Financial IQ\r\n        is how much money you keep and make it work for you. Financial IQ is how\r\n        efficient and smart you are at handling your finance. For example, how\r\n        effectively you budget your finance or how effectively you protect your\r\n        money from financial predators, etc all this constitutes and make use of\r\n        your financial IQ. Not only this, But financial IQ is also about how\r\n        aware you are about legalities . For example in real estate you have to\r\n        not only negotiate toughly but also have to use your financial IQ to the\r\n        fullest to actually land a deal that is workable and also protect\r\n        yourself from financial predators at the same time. More of it is\r\n        discussed later in this book. An example of financial IQ in action is as\r\n        follow:- imagine you are buying plants and you went to a plant shop for\r\n        that. Now you went there and bought a Tulsi plant for let’s say 300\r\n        Rupees. This is scenario number 1. Now scenario number 2. You go to the\r\n        plant shop to buy a Neem plant. But this time instead of giving whole\r\n        300 rupees , you get to know that government is subsidizing the tax rate\r\n        in it in a push to incentivize healthy and greener surroundings. So you\r\n        use that subsidizing tax claim and pay 250 Rupees. The simple act of\r\n        knowing about tax deduction and using it effectively is an example of\r\n        Financial IQ in action. Negotiating and bargaining is also an example of\r\n        Financial IQ in action. Budgeting your finance effectively in such a way\r\n        so as you have budget surplus and not deficit is also a sign of\r\n        Financial IQ in action.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Finance and legal go hand in hand , so if you keep yourself updated on\r\n        legalities , that is also helpful.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Who has more financial IQ? Raji or Rohan?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Rohan has more financial IQ, because paying bills is the last thing that\r\n        Rohan does. Paying bills is like paying others and minding their\r\n        business first before minding our own business first. Paying yourself\r\n        first also portrays a good financial behavior. Often people end up with\r\n        no money or very little money to invest in asset after paying bills and\r\n        spending their money on buying liabilities. If you think that your\r\n        earning money is not able to give you that amount of money, which you\r\n        need to invest in asset at the end of the month after paying bills or\r\n        2nd scenario that, after investing in asset you are left with no money\r\n        to little money to pay your bills at the end of the month, then that’s a\r\n        problem. And either your Financial Intelligence or your Financial IQ\r\n        (managing your finance smartly and efficiently) should lead you to find\r\n        the solution to that problem.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Maybe you will negotiate with your boss for a higher salary if you are\r\n        an earner. If you are a creator you will look for ways to create an\r\n        extra steady source of income. Creators invest only ONCE , their time,\r\n        effort and energy and keep earning REPEATEDLY from their one time\r\n        investment of time , effort and energy. As I said before they exchange\r\n        value for money, not their time, effort and energy. Maybe you will write\r\n        a book and sell it. Or you will get into affiliate marketing where you\r\n        just need to invest your time and effort one time only and that page\r\n        will give you returns without you working. In short you increase your\r\n        sources of income by using your financial intelligence. You start\r\n        looking for ways to create multiple stream of income. At first you will\r\n        definitely fail if you are transitioning from earner to creators, but\r\n        you will learn things, and creators never stop learning. You can do\r\n        anything that your financial intelligence directs you with.
