What that means is that in any one investment avenue, the price of\r\n        the asset involve in those investment avenue increases at fast rate in\r\n        less time. Why this happens?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Economist has defined asset bubble as “irrational exuberance”. When\r\n        people start investing in asset in the hope that it will grow in price,\r\n        as it has been, and they would be able to gain short term large profits\r\n        from it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        For example Bit coin bubble of 2017. Bit coin rose exponentially and a\r\n        fast rate and it became so popular that everybody , even those who don’t\r\n        have any experience in investing , wanted to invest in bit coin. A hype\r\n        was created about it. People were told to throw logic out the window and\r\n        just invest in bit coin. They were told don’t ask , just invest. So many\r\n        did. A Fear of missing out was created and if you were not investing in\r\n        bit coin you were termed as foolish. An environment was created where\r\n        people had to had invested in bit coin. But people don’t know why. They\r\n        just had to. It does not make sense? Well that is what asset bubble is ,\r\n        senseless increase of price , because everybody is investing in it and\r\n        the demand for the asset goes up. As with every bubble , it will burst.\r\n        And when it does , it will go down faster than it went up during the\r\n        bubble. If it took 2 days for a asset to go from 100 to 300 , it will\r\n        take 1 day to go from 300 to 50. Here is how the bubble is sometimes\r\n        naturally, but most of the time artificially created by some people for\r\n        their own advantage.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Imagine I buy a bit coin at 100 Rupees. Now I want this bit coin (asset)\r\n        to give me good returns. And I want it fast and large. What I would do\r\n        Is I would create a fake hype and would sell it in the market that “buy\r\n        bit coin , it’s gonna touch 500 or 300 today” . I share this news, fake\r\n        news, without any substantial logic or sense to back my claim among the\r\n        marketplace. Now people who look for tip and who are traders and all\r\n        would pick this “tip” up in the hope of short term large profit gains.\r\n        They will start buying the asset and would push others to do the same.\r\n        Until unless the hype is limited to seasoned investors and traders only\r\n        and not to people outside those circle, a bubble is not formed, yet.\r\n        Because of this sudden increase demand for asset, the price of bit coin\r\n        increases. Let’s say from 100 to 200. Now traders and investors who\r\n        invested early does not want this rally of price increase to stop, so\r\n        they start telling people who don’t invest regularly or are seasoned\r\n        investors , but are normal working class people to invest in bit coin as\r\n        in the coming days it is gonna go from 200 to 500. Now these gullible\r\n        working class , who have no idea about investment or trading just accept\r\n        their friends and family advise and invest a particular amount in those\r\n        asset. Result? More increase in demand for the asset pushing the price\r\n        more up. Bit coin touches 350 from 200. Those gullible workers who saw\r\n        their money increase (theoretically) now also does not want this rally\r\n        to stop. They want to earn more from their investment. So they share\r\n        this news that how they make extra 150 in just a day in bit coin without\r\n        doing anything and just by following the trend. His office workers would\r\n        hear this and then they would do the same thing, invest in bit coin and\r\n        inflate it prices. The Newspaper attention is now caught , and they\r\n        publish a news of rising prices of bit coin. People notice this and\r\n        start investing in this asset , pushing demand high and inflating the\r\n        price. Now bubble is formed. The next part of bubble is expansion. The\r\n        bubble would now expand and senseless hype would be created .Bit coin\r\n        start rising from 500 to 1000, from 1000 to 2000, from 2000 to 4000,\r\n        from 4000 to 8000. And so on and on. You will be termed foolish by not\r\n        investing in such an asset , because “look I made 2000 just by investing\r\n        mindlessly in the asset. And you are still here working in a job earning\r\n        pennies , while I am making thousands here by just investing senselessly\r\n        in bit coin.” In reality many would still hold their positions in the\r\n        market in the hope of earning more and more money. Their increase in\r\n        price only increase their positions in market theoretically. They have\r\n        to sell the asset only after selling it they make 2000 or something .\r\n        But they are not selling it in the hope of making more money out of it.\r\n        They are holding their positions in the market.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        And so the bubble expand , until unless as many people as they can\r\n        invest, invest in asset. This inflate the price of the asset to huge\r\n        prices . Prices that does not make sense. It’s all just hype price. You\r\n        will see a waiter of a restaurant investing in bit coin with his savings\r\n        left in the hope of making more money.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        If you might have seen the movie “ The Big Short “ there is this one\r\n        protagonist which is played by Steve Carell who goes to the ground to\r\n        verify that whether there is a bubble formation in real estate. He goes\r\n        to a stripper and talks with her. The Stripper says she has bought more\r\n        than one house and has 4 houses in adjustable loan rates, the type of\r\n        loans whose interest rate increase with time. That is when Steve Carell\r\n        character realises that there is huge bubble in the real estate.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The bubble would reach , by this inflation of price , at such a stage\r\n        that the prices would now remain at an all-time high for quite some\r\n        time. Or there would be some factors which if you would see and verify\r\n        and which are particular for every asset class, which will tell you that\r\n        the bubble has now reached its full potential and is now is going to\r\n        burst any second now. It is just waiting for that downward trend to\r\n        start.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        And when the downward trends starts, panic grips everyone. Remember\r\n        people have become habitual to seeing price increase only. And when a\r\n        dip comes in prices , they become paranoid. But the people don’t want\r\n        the rally of price rise to end, so they would fight against this dip and\r\n        would keep on creating hype. And so it would become hype Vs. reality.\r\n        And the game would go on for some time, reality would win in some and\r\n        hype in others. And then BOOM! The bubble burst. The market would cool\r\n        down. If the price increase rate was x, the downward rate of price of\r\n        asset is 10x. And in an instant of time , people who invested while the\r\n        going was great , are now left in deep losses. For example the price of\r\n        bitcoin during the top of the bubble phase was $19,783 ( 14,51,427\r\n        Rupees). The date at which this price was achieved was 17 December 2017.\r\n        At 22 December 2017 the price of bitcoin fell below $11,000 (8,07,401\r\n        Rupees) a fall of 45 %. By November 15, 2018 , the bitcoin was trading\r\n        at $ 5, 500 (4,03,520 Rupees).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Now imagine I being a gullible , who is not a regular investor or trader\r\n        , and who does not understand the nitty gritty details of investing or\r\n        stock market or asset bubble, invest with my money at say $17,500 or at\r\n        $ 18,000 and in few days see the money losses that I will incur when the\r\n        bubble burst. There are investors like these who lost their all savings\r\n        in such market craziness. And then there are others who create lots of\r\n        profit in such market bubble. For example the investors who invest early\r\n        in bubble create profit, but those investors , and they are the\r\n        majority, who invest in the upward trend or at the price mentioned above\r\n        and lose their savings and all. That’s why one should not use “tip” or\r\n        invest without first studying and educating oneself about investing.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Many asset bubbles has happened in the past. The boom bust cycle of tech\r\n        bubble or most famously known as “dotcom crash” of the 2000 , the real\r\n        estate market crash of 2006- 07 , leading to world financial crisis and\r\n        recession, and many more.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        The point here is how first, to protect yourself from bubble and 2nd how\r\n        to profit from it. Many of you would think of how to stop bubble from\r\n        generating itself at the first place so you can save gullible people\r\n        from falling into the trap. And yes that’s a good intention. I too would\r\n        like to join you in this endeavour. But society won’t. If there is\r\n        anything to be learn from history, especially in banking and market &\r\n        monetary history it is that we don’t learn anything and things keep\r\n        repeating again and again. Even if you say to your friend “ look there\r\n        is a bubble out there and if you invest at 17,000 then you can lose your\r\n        money in coming days” he will most probably reply “ what , dude this\r\n        asset has gone from this to that and people have made this much amount\r\n        of money (theoretically) in such amount of time, now why should it go\r\n        down, it will go up, just chill and see how I make thousands from this\r\n        asset”. Even if you tell them what’s happening they will go by their\r\n        choice , you can only educate people and make them aware and work\r\n        towards developing their financial intelligence , IQ and literacy. You\r\n        can’t change the world, but you can change yourself and make aware\r\n        people around you.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        So first, how to protect yourself from bubble. Before protecting\r\n        yourself from bubble , you have to identify the bubble. For that look\r\n        for data. You will see rising price of asset in double digits percentage\r\n        or triple digit percentage in a given time frame (1 year taken as\r\n        average ). If those number are high , then look for potential bubble\r\n        formation. Check out other statistics for that particular asset class.\r\n        For example if you are searching for a bubble in stock market , look P/E\r\n        or other statistics . You will realize that the data is inconsistent\r\n        with the prices and that is when you know that there is a bubble.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        2nd step, how to make profit from the bubble. You can make short term\r\n        profit from the bubble. Invest early if you can, and exit when you see\r\n        the statistics at an all-time red and the market is ready to explode and\r\n        cool down. You have to base your decision on the basis of data , not on\r\n        the basis of hype. You can buy early , and sell at the peak of bubble\r\n        formation. Or you can earn money while shorting stocks. What is shorting\r\n        of stocks?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Shorting of stocks is a phenomena where you sell stocks that you don’t\r\n        have. When you expect that a stock is going to come down, you sell\r\n        stocks that you don’t have but promise to deliver them. So a particular\r\n        stock might be at 100 Rupees, and say, you decide to short it. Now you\r\n        will sell these stocks ( which you don’t have ) to a buyer at 100. The\r\n        price of the stock , as you expected, comes down to 50 . You buy this\r\n        stock at 50 and make a profit of 50 Rupees.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        During the cooling of market, when you think according to the data, that\r\n        the bubble is going to burst , you can short the asset. You can sell an\r\n        asset which is at say $ 19,000 that you don’t own to a buyer , and when\r\n        the price comes down to 18,000 or so , you can buy it and make a profit\r\n        of 1,000. Of course in a rapid declining phase , such as in bubble ,\r\n        this profit multiply. But you will then set yourself up against the\r\n        people who are creating the hype. In general terms they are called bull,\r\n        and you will be categorised as bear.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        Well what would happen if the price does not go down but goes up? Well\r\n        then you are in trouble and I hope you have enough money to buy stocks\r\n        at a loss.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p className={cssClasses.paragraph}>\r\n        I again say that shorting of bonds comes in trading, and trading is\r\n        always risky. So you should use your own financial intelligence , IQ and\r\n        literacy , and decide for your own. Your investing style can be unique\r\n        as discussed before in this book. So decide and create your own\r\n        investing style that works the best for you. If you are comfortable with\r\n        trading and you think trading works for you, then you decide on your own\r\n        what you want to do & how you want to do that.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
